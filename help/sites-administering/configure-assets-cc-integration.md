# Configure AEM Assets integration with Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud {#configure-aem-assets-integration-with-experience-cloud-and-creative-cloud}

If you are an Adobe Experience Cloud customer, you can synchronize your assets within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets with Adobe Creative Cloud, and vice versa. You can also synchronize your assets with Experience Cloud and vice versa. You can set up this synchronization through Adobe I/O.

The workflow to set up this integration is:

1. Create an authentication in Adobe I/O using a public gateway and get an application ID.  
1. Create a profile on your AEM Assets instance using the appplication ID.
1. Use this configuration to synchronize your assets within AEM Assets with Creative Cloud.

At the backend, the AEM server authenticates your profile with the gateway and then synchronizes the data between AEM Assets and Experience Cloud.

>[!NOTE]

>AEM to Adobe Creative Cloud folder sharing feature is deprecated. Learn more and find a better method in [AEM and Creative Cloud integration best practices](../assets/aem-cc-integration-best-practices.md). The configuration of AEM to Marketing Cloud replication and exchanging assets between AEM Assets and Marketing Cloud is not deprecated.

   ![chlimage_1-295](assets/chlimage_1-295.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Sharing an Assets folder of the type `sling:OrderedFolder`, is not supported  in the context of sharing in Adobe Marketing Cloud. If you want to share a folder, when creating it in AEM Assets, do not select the **[!UICONTROL Ordered]** option.

1. Refresh the AEM Assets user interface. The folder you created in the Assets console of your local AEM Assets instance is copied to the Marketing Cloud UI. The asset that you upload to the folder in AEM Assets appears in the copy of the folder in Marketing Cloud after it is processed by the AEM server.
1. You can also upload an asset in the replicated copy of the folder in Marketing Cloud. After it is processed, the asset appears in the shared folder in AEM Assets.

## Exchange assets between AEM Assets and Creative Cloud {#exchange-assets-between-aem-assets-and-creative-cloud}

AEM Assets lets you share folders containing assets with Adobe Creative Cloud users.

1. In the Assets console, select the folder to share with Creative Cloud.
1. From the toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Share]** ![assets_share](assets/assets_share.png).
1. From the list, select the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Creative Cloud]** option.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The options are available for users with read permissions on the root. Users must have the required permission to access the replication agent information of Marketing Cloud.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Creative Cloud Sharing]** page, add the user to share the folder with and choose a role for the user. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** and click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.  

1. Log on to Creative Cloud with the credentials of the user you shared the folder with. The shared folder is available in Creative Cloud.

The AEM Assets-Marketing Cloud synchronization is designed in a way that the user machine instance from where the asset is uploaded retains the right to modify the asset. Only these changes are propagated to the other instance.

For example, if an asset is uploaded from an AEM Assets (on premises) instance, the changes to the asset from this instance are propagated to the Marketing Cloud instance. However, the changes done from the Marketing Cloud instance to the same asset aren’t propagated to the AEM instance and vice versa for asset uploaded from Marketing Cloud.
