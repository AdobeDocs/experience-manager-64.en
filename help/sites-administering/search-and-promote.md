# Integrating with Adobe Search&Promote{#integrating-with-adobe-search-promote}

To call the Adobe Search&Promote service from your website, perform the following tasks:

1. Specify the URL of the Cloud.
1. Configure the connection to the Search&Promote service.
1. Add Search&Promote components to [!UICONTROL Sidekick].
1. Use the components to author the content. (See [Adding Search&Promote Features to a Web Page](/help/sites-authoring/search-and-promote.md).)
1. Add banners to your pages. Banner images are sensitive to Search&Promote data.
1. Generate a site map for the Search&Promote service to consume.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are using Search&Promote with a custom proxy configuration, you need to configure both HTTP Client proxy configurations as some functionalities of AEM are using the 3.x APIs and some others the 4.x APIs:
>
>* 3.x is configured with [http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/com.day.commons.httpclient](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/com.day.commons.httpclient)
>* 4.x is configured with [http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.http.proxyconfigurator](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.http.proxyconfigurator)
>

**To change the Search&Promote service URL**:

1. Open the [!UICONTROL OSGi] console and tap the **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** tab. ([http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr.](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr))  

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Day CQ Search&Promote Configuration]** item.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Remote Server URI]** text field, enter the URL, then tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Configuring the connection to Search&Promote {#configuring-the-connection-to-search-promote}

Configure one or more connections to Search&Promote so that your web pages can interact with the service. To connect, you need the member identification and account number of your Search&Promote account.

**To configure the connection to Search&Promote**:

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** icon &gt; **[!UICONTROL Deployment]**, select **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]**.

   This takes you to the Cloud Services Dashboard. If on a local machine, the url of the dashboard will look something like this:

   [http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/core/content/tools/cloudservices.html](http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/core/content/tools/cloudservices.html)

1. In the [!UICONTROL Cloud Services] page, tap the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Search&Promote]** link or the **[!UICONTROL Search&Promote]** icon.  

1. If this is the first time you are configuring Adobe Search&Promote, tap **[!UICONTROL Configure Now]** to open the [!UICONTROL Create Configuration] panel.

   >
   >using your valid Seach&Promote credentials (email/password).

   >
   >[](https://searchandpromote.omniture.com/px/home/?sp_id=XXXXXXXX-spYYYYYYYY)
   >
   >[https://searchandpromote.omniture.com/px/home/?sp_id=XXXXXXXX-spYYYYYYYY](https://searchandpromote.omniture.com/px/home/?sp_id=XXXXXXXX-spYYYYYYYY)
   >
   >Where **XXXXXXXX** corresponds to your **[!UICONTROL Member id]** and **[!UICONTROL spYYYYYYYY]** corresponds to your account number.

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Connect To Search&Promote]**.

   When the connection success message appears, tap **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

## Configuring the Data Center {#configuring-the-data-center}

**To configure the data center**:

1. Navigate to the Web console at `http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/com.day.cq.searchpromote.impl.SearchPromoteServiceImpl`

   ![chlimage_1-411](assets/chlimage_1-411.png)

1. Depending on the location of the server, change the URI to one of the following:

    * North America: [https://center.atomz.com/px/](https://center.atomz.com/px/)
    * EMEA: [https://center.lon5.atomz.com/px/](https://center.lon5.atomz.com/px/)
    * APAC: [https://center.sin2.atomz.com/px/](https://center.sin2.atomz.com/px/)

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Adding Search&Promote components to Sidekick {#adding-search-promote-components-to-sidekick}

In [!UICONTROL Design] mode, edit a **[!UICONTROL par]** component to allow the Search&Promote components in [!UICONTROL Sidekick]. (See the [Components](/help/sites-developing/components.md) documentation for more information.)

For information about using the components, see [Adding Search&Promote features to a Web Page](/help/sites-authoring/search-and-promote.md).

## Specifying the Search&Promote service that your pages use {#specifying-the-search-promote-service-that-your-pages-use}

Configure web pages so that they use a specific Search&Promote service. Search&Promote components automatically use the service of their host page.

When you configure the Search&Promote properties for a page, all child pages inherit the settings. If required, you can configure child pages to override the inherited settings.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The service connection must already be configured. See [Configure the connection to Search&Promote](#configuring-the-connection-to-search-promote).

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Page Properties]** dialog box. For example, on the **[!UICONTROL Websites]** page, right-click the page and click **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.  

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** tab.  

1. To disable the inheritance of cloud services configurations from a parent page, click the padlock icon next to the inheritance path.

   ![sandpinheritpadlock](assets/sandpinheritpadlock.png)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Service]**, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Search&Promote]**, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.  

1. Select the connection configuration for your Search&Promote account, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

## Product Feed {#product-feed}

The Search&Promote integration lets you do the following:

* Use the [!UICONTROL eCommerce] API, independently of the underlying repository structure and commerce platform.
* Leverage the [!UICONTROL Index Connector] feature of Search&Promote to provide a product feed in XML format.
* Leverage the [!UICONTROL Remote Control] feature of Search&Promote to perform on-demand or scheduled requests of the product feed.
* Feed generation for different Search&Promote accounts, configured as cloud services configurations.

For more information, see [Product Feed](/help/sites-administering/product-feed.md).
