# Configure the Video component {#configure-the-video-component}

>[CAUTION]
>
>AEM 6.4 has reached the end of extended support and this documentation is no longer updated. For further details, see our [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the supported versions [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/).

The [Video component](/help/sites-authoring/default-components-foundation.md#video) lets you place a predefined, OOTB (out-of-the-box) video element on your page.

For proper transcoding to occur, your administrator must [Install FFmpeg and configure AEM](#install-ffmpeg) separately. They can also [Configure your Video Profiles](#configure-video-profiles) for use with HTML5 elements.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This component is no longer expected to function out-of-the-box without extensive project-level customization.

## Configure video profiles {#configure-video-profiles}

You may want to define video profiles to use for HTML5 elements. Those chosen here are used in order. To access, use [Design Mode](/help/sites-authoring/default-components-designmode.md) (Classic UI only) and select the **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** tab:

You can also configure the design of the video components and parameters for [!UICONTROL Playback], [!UICONTROL Flash], and [!UICONTROL Advanced].

## Install FFmpeg and configure AEM {#install-ffmpeg}

The Video Component relies on the third-party open-source product FFmpeg for proper transcoding of videos that can be downloaded from [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/). After you install FFmpeg, you must configure AEM to use a specific audio codec and specific runtime options.

**To install FFmpeg for your platform**:

* **On Windows:**

    1. Download the compiled binary as `ffmpeg.zip` 
    1. Unzip to a folder. 
    1. Set the system environment variable `PATH` to `<*your-ffmpeg-locatio*n>\bin` 
    1. Restart AEM.

* **On Mac OS X:**

    1. Install Xcode ([https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html))
    1. Install XQuartz/X11.
    1. Install MacPorts ([https://www.macports.org/](https://www.macports.org/))
    1. In the console run the following command and follow the instructions: 

       `sudo port install ffmpeg` 

       `FFmpeg` must be in `PATH` so AEM can pick it up via command line.

* **Using the precompiled version for OS X 10.6:**

    1. Download the precompiled version.
    1. Extract it to the `/usr/local` directory.
    1. From terminal, execute: 

       `sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/0.6/bin/ffmpeg /usr/bin/ffmpeg`

**To configure AEM**:

1. Open [!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite] in your web browser. ([http://localhost:4502/crx/de](http://localhost:4502/crx/de))
1. Select the `/libs/settings/dam/video/format_aac/jcr:content` node and ensure that the node properties are as follows:

    * audioCodec: 
    
      ``` 
       aac
      ``` 
    
    * customArgs: 
    
      ``` 
       -flags +loop -me_method umh -g 250 -qcomp 0.6 -qmin 10 -qmax 51 -qdiff 4 -bf 16 -b_strategy 1 -i_qfactor 0.71 -cmp chroma -subq 8 -me_range 16 -coder 1 -sc_threshold 40 -b-pyramid normal -wpredp 2 -mixed-refs 1 -8x8dct 1 -fast-pskip 1 -keyint_min 25 -refs 4 -trellis 1 -direct-pred 3 -partitions i8x8,i4x4,p8x8,b8x8
      ```

1. To customize the configuration, create an overlay in `/apps/settings/` node and move the same structure under `/conf/global/settings/` node. It cannot be edited in `/libs` node. For example, to overlay path `/libs/settings/dam/video/fullhd-bp`, create it at `/conf/global/settings/dam/video/fullhd-bp`.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Overlay and edit the entire profile-node and not just the property that needs modification. Such resources are not resolved via SlingResourceMerger.

1. If you changed either of the properties, click **[!UICONTROL Save All]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>OOTB workflow models are not preserved when you upgrade your AEM instance. Adobe recommends that you copy OOTB workflow models before editing them. For example, copy the OOTB DAM Update Asset model before editing the FFmpeg Transcoding step in the DAM Update Asset model to pick video-profile names that existed before the upgrade. Then, you can overlay the `/apps` node to let AEM retrieve the custom changes to the OOTB model.
