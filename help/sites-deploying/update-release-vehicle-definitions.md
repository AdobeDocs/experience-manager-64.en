* [1]: OAK fixes are not delivered as individual hot fixes. However, they are included in the subsequent Cumulative Oak hot fix. If necessary, a diagnostic build on top of the latest COFP can be made available. The precondition is that the customer has the latest COFP running. Diagnostic builds only provide the same level quality assurance as a hot fix. Therefore, they don't provide the same level of quality assurance as a cumulative fix pack, service pack, or product release. The final fix is delivered with the next COFP.
