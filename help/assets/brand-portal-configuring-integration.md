# Configure AEM Assets integration with Brand Portal {#configure-aem-assets-integration-with-brand-portal}

Learn how to integrate AEM Assets with Brand Portal for publishing assets and Collections to Brand Portal.

If you are an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal customer, you can integrate AEM Assets with Brand Portal to enable publishing of assets to Brand Portal. You can set up this integration through Adobe.io interface.

> [!Note]
>
>Adobe recommends upgrading to AEM 6.4.1.0 or later to ensure that AEM Assets Brand Portal is integrated with AEM Assets. A limitation in AEM 6.4 gives an error while configuring integration with Brand Portal and replication fails.

First, create an application, which includes an authentication mechanism, in the Marketing Cloud public gateway. Next, create a profile in your AEM Assets instance using the application ID that you obtain from the gateway.

Use this configuration to publish assets from AEM Assets to Brand Portal. At the backend, the AEM server authenticates your profile with the gateway and then integrates AEM Assets with Brand Portal.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The UI for configuring oAuth integrations is hosted in [https://legacy-oauth.cloud.adobe.io/](https://legacy-oauth.cloud.adobe.io/), which was earlier hosted in [https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/).

After the cloud service is configured, additional configuration is not required to enable the replication agents that are activated by default to enable parallel publishing of multiple assets.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Avoid disabling any of the replication agents, as it can cause the replication of some of the assets to fail.
