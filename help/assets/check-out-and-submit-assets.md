# Check-in and check-out files in Assets {#check-in-and-check-out-files-in-assets}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets lets you check-out assets for editing and check them back in after you complete making the changes. After you check-out an asset, only you can edit, annotate, publish, move, or delete the asset. Checking out an asset locks the asset. Other users cannot perform any of these operations on the asset until you check the asset back in to AEM Assets. However, they can still change the metadata for the locked asset.

To be able to check-out or check-in assets, you require Write access on them.

This feature helps prevent other users from overriding the changes made by an author where multiple users collaborate on editing workflows across teams.

## Check-out assets {#checking-out-assets}

1. From the Assets UI, select the asset you want to check-out. You can also select multiple assets to check-out.

   To verify whether other users can edit the asset you checked out, log in as a different user. A lock icon appears on the thumbnail of the asset that you checked out.
