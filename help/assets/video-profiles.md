# Dynamic Media video profiles {#video-profiles}

Dynamic Media already comes with a predefined Adaptive Video Encoding profile. The settings in this out-of-the-box profile are optimized to give your customers the best viewing experience possible. When you encode your master videos using the Adaptive Video Encoding profile, during playback the video player automatically adjusts the quality of the video stream based on the Internet connection speed of your customers. This is known as adaptive streaming.

The following are other factors that determine the quality of your videos:

* **Resolution of the uploaded master video**
  
  If the MP4 video was recorded at a lower resolution, such as 240p or 360p, it cannot be streamed in high definition.
  
* **Video player size**  
  
  By default, the **[!UICONTROL Width]** in the Adaptive Video Encoding profile is set to **[!UICONTROL Auto]**. Again, during playback, the best quaility is used based on the size of the player.

See also [Best Practices for Video Encoding](video.md#best-practices-for-encoding-videos).

>[!NOTE]
>
>To generate a video's metadata and associated video image thumbnails, the video itself needs to go through the encoding process in Dynamic Media. In AEM, the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Encode Video]** workflow encodes video if you have enabled dynamic media and set up video cloud services. This workflow captures workflow process history and failure information. 
>
>See [Monitoring video encoding and YouTube publishing progress](video.md#monitoring-video-encoding-and-youtube-publishing-progress). If you have enabled Dynamic Media and set up video cloud services, the **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Media Encode Video]** workflow automatically takes effect when you upload a video. (If you are not using dynamic media, the **[!UICONTROL DAM Update Asset]** workflow takes effect.)
>
>Metadata is useful when you are searching for assets. The thumbnails are static video images that are generated during encoding. They are required by the AEM system and used in the user interface to help you visually identify videos in the **[!UICONTROL Cards View]**, **[!UICONTROL Search Results]** view, and the **[!UICONTROL Asset List]** view. You can see the generated thumbnails when you tap the **[!UICONTROL Renditions]** icon (a painter's palette) of an encoded video.

When you are done creating the video profile, you apply it to a folder or mutliple folders. See [Applying a video profile to folders.](#applying-a-video-profile-to-folders)

To define advanced processing parameters for other asset types, see [Configuring Asset Processing](config-dms7.md#configuring-asset-processing).

## Creating a Dynamic Media video encoding profile for adaptive streaming {#creating-a-video-encoding-profile-for-adaptive-streaming}

Dynamic Media already comes with a predefined Adaptive Video Encoding profile&ndash;a group of video upload settings for MP4 H.264&ndash;that is optimized for the best viewing experience. You can use this profile when you upload your videos.

However, if this predefined profile does not meet your needs, you can choose to create your own adaptive video encoding profile. When you use the setting **[!UICONTROL Encode for adaptive streaming]**&ndash;*a best practice*&ndash; all encoding presets that you add to the profile are validated to ensure that all videos have the same aspect ratio. In addition, the encoded videos are treated as a multi-bitrate set for streaming.

When you create the video encoding profile, you will notice that most encoding options are pre-populated with recommended default settings to help you. However, if you select a value other than the recommended default, be aware that it may result in poor video quality during playback and other performance issues.

So, for all MP4 H.264 video encoding presets in the profile, the following values are validated to ensure that they are the same across individual encoding presets in the profile, thereby making adaptive streaming possible:

* Video Format Codec - MP4 H.264 (.mp4)
* Audio Codec
* Audio Bitrate
* Keep Aspect Ratio
* Two Pass Encoding
* Constant Bitrate
* H264 Profile
* Audio Sampling Rate

If the values are not the same, you can continue creating the profile as is. However, be aware that adaptive streaming will not be possible. Instead, users will experience single-bitrate streaming. It is recommended that you edit the encoding settings to use the same values across individual encoding presets in the profile. (Note that the video profile/preset editor should enforce parity of the adaptive video encoding settings if **[!UICONTROL Encode for adaptive streaming]** is enabled.)

See also [Best Practices for Video Encoding](video.md#best-practices-for-encoding-videos).

To define advanced processing parameters for other asset types, see [Configuring Asset Processing](config-dms7.md#configuring-asset-processing).

When you are done creating the video profile, you apply it to a folder or multiple folders.

**To create a Dynamic Media video encoding profile for adaptive streaming**:

1. Tap or click the AEM logo and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools > Assets > Video Profiles]**.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Create]** to add a new video profile.  

1. Enter a name and description for the profile.
1. Ensure that **[!UICONTROL Encode for adaptive streaming]** is checked (default).
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Add Video Encoding Preset]**.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Basic]** tab, set the video and audio options.  

   Tap the information icon next to each option for additional descriptions or recommended settings based on the selected video format codec.

1. Under the Video Size heading, ensure that **[!UICONTROL Keep aspect ratio]** is checked.
1. Set the video frame size resolution in pixels. Use the **[!UICONTROL Auto]** value to automatically scale to match the source aspect ratio (width to height ratio). For example, Auto x 480 or 640 x Auto.

   Do one of the following:

    * In the **[!UICONTROL Width]** field, enter **[!UICONTROL auto]**. In the **[!UICONTROL Height]** field, enter a value in pixels.
    * To help you visualize the size of the video, tap the **[!UICONTROL Information]** icon (i) to the right of **[!UICONTROL Height]** to open the **[!UICONTROL Size Calculator]** page. Use **[!UICONTROL Size Calculator]** to set the video dimensions (represented by the blue box) you want. Tap **[!UICONTROL X]** in the upper-right corner when you are done.

1. (Optional) Tap the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab and ensure the **[!UICONTROL Use Default Values]** check box is selected (recommended). Alternatively, modify advanced video and audio settings.
1. In the upper-right corner of the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the preset.
1. Do one of the following:

    * Repeat steps 5-10 to create additional encoding presets. (Adaptive video streaming requires more than one video preset.) 
    * In the upper-right corner of the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Save]** again to save the profile.

## Monitoring the Progress of an encoding job {#monitoring-the-progress-of-an-encoding-job}

A processing indicator (or progress bar) is displayed so you can visually monitor the progress of a video encoding job.

You can also view the `error.log` file to monitor the progress of an encoding job, to see if encoding is finished, or to see any job errors. The `error.log` is found in the `logs` folder where your instance of AEM is installed.

## Creating a Dynamic Media video encoding profile for progressive streaming {#creating-a-video-encoding-profile-for-progressive-streaming}

If you choose not to use the option **[!UICONTROL Encode for adaptive streaming]**, be aware that all encoding presets that you add to the profile are treated as individual video renditions for single-bitrate streaming or progressive video delivery. Also, there is no validation to ensure that all the video renditions have the same aspect ratio.

Depending on which mode you are running, the supported video format codecs are the following:

* Dynamic Media-Scene7 mode: H.264 (.mp4)
* Dynamic Media-Hybrid mode: H.264 (.mp4), WebM

## Using custom-added video encoding parameters {#using-custom-added-video-encoding-parameters}

You can edit an existing video encoding profile to take advantage of advanced video encoding parameters that are not found in the user interface when you create or edit a Video Profile in AEM. You custom add one or more advanced parameters&mdash;such as **[!UICONTROL minBitrate]** and **[!UICONTROL maxBitrate]**&mdash;to your existing profile.

**To use custom-added video encoding parameters**:

1. Tap the AEM logo, then navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools > General > CRXDE Lite]**.
1. From the **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]** page, in the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]** panel on the left, navigate to the following:

   `/conf/global/settings/dam/dm/presets/video/*name_of_video_encoding_profile_to_edit*`

1. In the panel on the lower-right side of the page, from the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab, specify the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, **[!UICONTROL Type]**, and **[!UICONTROL Value]** of the parameter you want to use.

   The following advanced parameters are available to use:

   <table> 
    <tbody> 
    <tr> 
    <td><strong>Name</strong></td> 
    <td><strong>Description</strong><br /> </td>

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Video Profiles]** page, check one or more video profile names.
1. On the toolbar, tap **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

## Applying a Dynamic Media video profile to folders {#applying-a-video-profile-to-folders}

When you assign a video profile to a folder, any subfolders automatically inherit the profile from its parent folder. This means that you can assign only one video profile to a folder. As such, consider carefully the folder structure of where you upload, store, use, and archive assets.

If you assigned a different video profile to a folder, the new profile overrides the previous profile. The previously existing folder assets remain unchanged. The new profile is applied on the assets that are added to the folder later.

Folders that have a profile assigned to it are indicated in the user interface by the name of the profile appearing in the card name.

![chlimage_1-517](assets/chlimage_1-517.png)

You can apply video profiles to specific folders or globally to all assets.

### Applying video profiles to specific folders {#applying-video-profiles-to-specific-folders}

You can apply a video profile to a folder from within the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** menu or if you are in the folder, from the **[!UICONTROL Properties]**. This section describes how to apply video profiles to folders both ways.

Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.

#### Applying Dynamic Media video profiles to folders from Profiles user interface {#applying-video-profiles-to-folders-from-profiles-user-interface}

1. Tap the AEM logo and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools > Assets > Video Profiles]**.
1. Select the video profile that you want to apply to a folder or multiple folders.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Apply Profile to Folder(s)]** and select the folder or multiple folders you want use to receive the newly uploaded assets and tap **[!UICONTROL Apply]**. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.

#### Applying Dynamic Media video profiles to folders from Properties {#applying-video-profiles-to-folders-from-properties}

1. Tap the AEM logo and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Assets]** and then to the folder that you want to apply a video profile to.
1. On the folder, tap the check mark to select it and then tap **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Video Profiles]** tab and select the profile from the drop-down menu and tap **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]**. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.

   ![chlimage_1-518](assets/chlimage_1-518.png)

### Applying a Dynamic Media video profile globally {#applying-a-video-profile-globally}

In addition to applying a profile to a folder, you can also apply one globally so that any content uploaded into AEM assets in any folder has the selected profile applied.

**To apply a Dynamic Media video profile globally**:

1. Navigate to CRXDE Lite to the following node: `/content/dam/jcr:content`.
1. Add the property **[!UICONTROL videoProfile]**: `/etc/dam/video/dynamicmedia/<name_of_video_encoding_profile>`
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save All]**. 

  ![chlimage_1-519](assets/chlimage_1-519.png)

## Removing a Dynamic Media video profile from folders {#removing-a-video-profile-from-folders}

When you remove a video profile from a folder, any subfolders automatically inherit the removal of the profile from its parent folder. However, any processing of files that has occurred within the folders remains intact.

You can remove a video profile from a folder from within the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** menu or if you are in the folder, from the **[!UICONTROL Folder Settings]**. This section describes how to remove video profiles from folders both ways.

### Removing Dynamic Media video profiles from folders by way of Profiles user interface {#removing-video-profiles-from-folders-via-profiles-user-interface}

1. Tap the AEM logo and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools > Assets > Video Profiles]**.
1. Select the video profile that you want to remove from a folder or multiple folders.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Remove Profile from Folder(s)]** and select the folder or multiple folders you want use to remove the profile from and tap **[!UICONTROL Remove]**.

   You can confirm that the video profile is no longer applied to a folder because the name no longer appears below the folder name.

### Removing Dynamic Media video profiles from folders by way of Properties {#removing-video-profiles-from-folders-via-properties}

1. Tap the AEM logo and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Assets]** and then to the folder that you want to remove a video profile from.
1. On the folder, tap the check mark to select it, then tap **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Video Profiles]** tab and select **[!UICONTROL None]** from the drop-down menu and tap **[!UICONTROL Save & Close]**. Folders that have a profile already assigned to it are indicated by the display of the profile's name directly below the folder name.
