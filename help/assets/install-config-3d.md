   Continue with [Validating the setup of AEM 3D](#validating-the-setup-of-aem-d).

## Validating the setup of AEM 3D {#validating-the-setup-of-aem-d}

1. In AEM, click **[!UICONTROL Tools > Assets]**, then download `sample-3D-content.zip`, and expand the downloaded file. (You can now delete `sample-3D-content.zip` in AEM.)

   Make sure you are in **[!UICONTROL Card View]** to view upload and processing feedback in the remaining steps.

1. Create a folder named `test3d` to receive test content.
1. Upload all files from `sample-3D-content/images` to the `test3d` folder.
1. Wait for the upload and processing to complete. You may need to refresh your browser.

   Upload the three `.fbx` files from `sample-3D-content/` to the `test3d` folder.

   Do not upload the .ma model files yet.

1. In the Card View, observe the message banners that are shown on the 3d asset cards.

   Each asset proceeds through several processing steps. When the **[!UICONTROL Creating Preview...]** processing step completes, the card is updated with a thumbnail image. When final processing is completed, the banner is replaced with the **[!UICONTROL NEW]** indicator.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Expect very high CPU utilization while 3D processing is in progress. Depending on available CPU capacity it may take a substantial amount of time to complete all processing.

   ![screenshot_2017-01-2518-29-32](assets/screenshot_2017-01-2518-29-32.png)

## Configuring support for Adobe Dimension assets {#configuring-support-for-adobe-dimension-assets}

>[!NOTE]
>
>This configuration task is optional.

You can optionally configure support in AEM 3D for Adobe Dimension assets.

You must configure an external conversion service to allow ingestion, preview, and publishing of Adobe Dimension 3D assets in AEM. The service converts from the proprietary Adobe Dimension (`.dn`) format to a variant of glTF (formatted as a `.glb` file) which is saved with the Dn asset as a rendition. The `.glb` rendition is used for web-based viewing of the 3D asset in AEM Assets, Sites, and Screens, and is also available for downloading for use with third-party applications.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The conversion service is hosted by Adobe in Amazon AWS. After properly configuring the service, `.dn` files uploaded to AEM are then copied securely to the conversion service by way of temporary storage in Amazon S3. The conversion result is transferred back to AEM by way of temporary S3 storage. All transfers and storage are secured. Also, the content persists in S3 and the conversion service only briefly (typically no more than a few minutes).

**To configure suoport for Adobe Dimension assets**:

1. Contact your Adobe AEM account manager, provisioning expert, or support representative to request credentials for **AEM3D Services**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Only one set of credentials is required for each organization, regardless of the number of AEM instances on which the credentials are installed.

1. Verify that you have received the following information:

    * accountId
    * customerId
    * password
    * identityPoolId
    * userPoolId
    * clientId

1. As Administrator, log into your AEM author instance where you want the credentials installed, then open **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]**.
1. Configure the new credentials information by doing the following in CRXDE Lite:

    1. Navigate to `/libs/settings/dam/v3D/services/dncr` and set the `clientId` property to the new value.
    1. Navigate to `/libs/settings/dam/v3D/services/aws` and set the `accountId`, `customerId`, `identityPoolId`, and `userPoolId` properties to the new values.
    1. Load the new password value into the `encryptedPassword` property. This value is automatically encrypted when you tap **[!UICONTROL Save All]**.
    1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save All]**, reload the page, then verify that the `encryptedPassword` property shows a different string enclosed by curly braces. This appearance indicates that the password is properly encrypted and secure.

1. Specify the format of the `.glb` conversion rendition by doing the following in **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]**:

    1. Navigate to `/libs/settings/dam/v3D/services/dncr` in **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]**.
    1. Set the `outputFormat` property to either `Dn` or `generic`.

       When set to `Dn`, the `.glb` conversion includes Adobe-specific extensions, such as IBL lighting, for best quality when viewing Dn assets in AEM. However, the converted .glb rendition may not render well in third-party applications.  

       When set to `generic`, the `.glb` rendition is generic without Adobe-specific extensions. This setting allows it to be used in third-party applications, while viewing with the AEM 3D viewer will be visually sub-optimal.

1. Enable the Dn file format by doing the following in **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]**:

    1. Navigate to `/libs/settings/dam/v3D/assetTypes/Dn`.
    1. Set the `Enabled` property to true.

1. Validate the configuration by doing the following:

    1. Open AEM Assets.
    1. Upload `logo_sphere.dn` to the `test3d` folder. The file is located in `sample-3D-content/models`.

       Note that `sample-3D-content.zip` was previously downloaded for validating the basic 3D functionality. 
    1. Return to the **[!UICONTROL Card View]** and observe the message banner shown on the uploaded asset. The **[!UICONTROL Converting Format...]** banner is displayed while the conversion process is in progress.
    1. After all processing is complete, open the asset in **[!UICONTROL Detail View]** to verify that the converted asset is displayed correctly and that the viewer's navigation controls are usable.

   ![image2018-11-2_15-51-19](assets/image2018-11-2_15-51-19.png)

   If a "Processing Error" is displayed on the Dn asset in the **[!UICONTROL Card View]** after 10-15 minutes, the conversion failed.

   If such case, you can troubleshoot the conversion by doing the following:

    * Delete the asset, then upload it again.
    * Ensure that you have correctly set all configuration parameters in **[!UICONTROL CRXDE Lite]**.
    * Verify that no firewall is blocking access to the conversion service and AWS endpoints.
