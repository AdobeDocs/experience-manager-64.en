# Enabling Duplicate Detection {#enabling-duplicate-detection}

If you attempt to upload an asset that exists in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets, the duplicate detection feature identifies it as duplicate. Duplicate detection is disabled by default. To enable the feature, do the following steps:

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Web Console Configuration]** page at `https://[server]:[port]/system/console/configMgr`.
1. Edit the configuration for the servlet **[!UICONTROL Day CQ DAM Create Asset]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL detect duplicate]** option, and click/tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   ![Select detect duplicate option in the servlet](assets/chlimage_1-377.png)

The detect duplicate feature is now enabled in AEM Assets. When a user attempts to upload an asset that exists in AEM, the system checks for conflict and indicates it. The assets are identified using SHA-1 hash stored at `jcr:content/metadata/dam:sha1`, which means duplicate assets are detected irrespective of the filenames.
