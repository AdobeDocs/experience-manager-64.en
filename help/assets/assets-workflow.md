# Apply workflows to assets {#applying-workflows-to-assets}

Applying workflows to digital assets is the same as for website pages. For a complete guide on how to create and use workflows in AEM, see [Starting Workflows](../sites-authoring/workflows-participating.md).

Use workflows in digital assets to activate the asset or create watermarks. Many of the workflows for assets are automatically turned on. For example, the workflow that automatically creates a rendition after an image is edited is automatically turned on.

If a workflow available in Classic UI is not available in Touch-enabled UI, like Request to Activate and Request to Deactivate, see [Make workflow models available in Touch UI](../sites-developing/workflows-models.md#make-workflow-models-available-in-touchui).

## Applying a workflow to multiple folders {#applying-a-workflow-to-multiple-folders}

The procedure to apply a workflow to multiple folders is similar to the procedure to apply a workflow to multiple assets. Select the folders in the Assets console, and perform steps 2-7 of the procedure [Applying a workflow to multiple assets](assets-workflow.md#applying-a-workflow-to-multiple-assets).

## Applying a workflow to a collection {#applying-a-workflow-to-a-collection}
