# Organize you digital assets {#organize-digital-assets}

All digital assets, metadata and content of Microsoft Office and PDF documents are extracted and made searchable. Search allows sophisticated filtering on assets and fully respects the proper permissions. Metadata is covered in detail in Metadata in Digital Asset Management.

AEM Assets supports multiple ways of organizing content. You can organize them in a hierarchical manner using folders or you can organize them in an unordered, ad-hoc manner, using for example tags. Users can edit tags in the DAM Asset Editor where sub-assets, renditions, and metadata are displayed.

## Organize assets in folders {#organize-using-folders}

The most basic way to organize assets is to save these in folders. It is analogous to organizing files in folders in our local filesystem. To create and manage folders, see [Managing assets](managing-assets-touch-ui.md).

## Organize assets using tags {#use-tags-to-organize-assets}

Using tags, as a metadata, you can easily search assets, create collections using the search results, boost search ranking for some assets, and leverage Adobe Sensei's AI algorithms for asset discovery.

Adobe Experience Manager Assets uses a self-learning algorithm to create highly descriptive tags that allow you to find the right asset in just a few clicks. Smart tagging uses Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which can be trained to recognize and apply both standard and business-specific tags to imagery. Smart Tags can also identify content, individual words, or phrases and automatically apply descriptive tags to assets

## Organize as collections {#organize-as-collections}

With asset collections in Experience Manager Assets, you can streamline the ability to create, edit and share assets between users. Create several types of collections based on the way you use them, including collections that contain a static reference list of assets, folders and collections, as well as collections that pull in assets based on search criteria.  You also can create collections with assets from different locations and share them with multiple users with different levels of access, viewing and editing privileges.
