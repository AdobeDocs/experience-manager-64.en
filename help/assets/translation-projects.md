# Creating Translation Projects {#creating-translation-projects}

>[CAUTION]
>
>AEM 6.4 has reached the end of extended support and this documentation is no longer updated. For further details, see our [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the supported versions [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/).

To create a language copy, trigger one of the following language copy workflows available under the References rail in the Assets UI:

**Create and translate**

In this workflow, assets to be translated are copied to the language root of the language to which you want to translate. In addition, depending upon the options you choose, a translation project is created for the assets in the Projects console. Depending on the settings, the translation project can be started manually or allowed to run automatically as soon as the translation project is created.

**Update language copies**

You run this workflow to translate an additional group of assets and include it in a language copy for a particular locale. In this case, the translated assets are added to the target folder that already contains previously-translated assets.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Asset binaries are translated only if the translation service provider supports the translation of binaries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you launch a translation workflow for complex assets, such as PDFs and InDesign files, their subassets or renditions (if any) are not submitted for translation.

## Create and translate workflow {#create-and-translate-workflow}

You use the Create and translate workflow to generate language copies for a particular language for the first time. The workflow provides the following options:

* Create structure only
* Create a new translation project
* Add to existing translation project

### Create structure only {#create-structure-only}

Use the **Create structure only** option to create a target folder hierarchy within the target language root to match the hierarchy of the source folder within the source language root. In this case, source assets are copied to the destination folder. However, no translation project is generated.

1. In the Assets UI, select the source folder for which you want to create a structure in the target language root.
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL References]** pane and click/tap **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** under **[!UICONTROL Copies]**.

1. Click/tap **[!UICONTROL Create & Translate]** at the bottom.

   ![chlimage_1-58](assets/chlimage_1-58.png)

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Target Languages]** list, select the language for which you want to create a folder structure.

   ![chlimage_1-59](assets/chlimage_1-59.png)

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Project]** list, choose **[!UICONTROL Create structure only]**.

   ![chlimage_1-60](assets/chlimage_1-60.png)

1. Click/tap **[!UICONTROL Create]**. The new structure for the target language is listed under **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]**.

   ![chlimage_1-61](assets/chlimage_1-61.png)

1. Click/tap the structure from the list, and then click/tap **[!UICONTROL Reveal in Assets]** to navigate to the folder structure within the target language.

   ![chlimage_1-62](assets/chlimage_1-62.png)

### Create a new translation project {#create-a-new-translation-project}

If you use this option, assets to be translated are copied to the language root of the language to which you want to translate. Depending upon the options you choose, a translation project is created for the assets in the Projects console. Depending on the settings, the translation project can be started manually or runs automatically as soon as the translation project is created.

1. In the Assets UI, select the source folder for which you want to create a Language copy.
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL References]** pane and click/tap **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** under **[!UICONTROL Copies]**.

   ![chlimage_1-63](assets/chlimage_1-63.png)

1. Click/tap **[!UICONTROL Create & Translate]** at the bottom.

   ![chlimage_1-64](assets/chlimage_1-64.png)

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Target Languages]** list, select the language(s) for which you want to create a folder structure.

   ![chlimage_1-65](assets/chlimage_1-65.png)

   >This feature is available both for assets and folders. When an asset is selected instead of a folder, the entire hierarchy of folders upto the language root is copied to create a language copy for the asset.

### Add to existing translation project {#add-to-existing-translation-project}

If you use this option, the translation workflow runs for assets that you add to the source folder after running a previous translation workflow. Only the newly-added assets are copied to the target folder that contains previously-translated assets. No new translation project is created in this case.

1. In the Assets UI, navigate to the source folder that contains untranslated assets.
1. Select an asset you want to translate, and open the **[!UICONTROL Reference pane]**. The **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** section displays the number of translation copies that are currently available.

## Creating temporary language copies {#creating-temporary-language-copies}

When you run a translation workflow to update a language copy with edited versions of original assets, the existing language copy is preserved until you approve the translated asset(s). [!DNL Experience Manager] Assets stores the newly-translated asset(s) at a temporary location and updates the existing language copy after you explicitly approve the asset(s). If you reject the asset(s), the language copy remains unchanged.

1. Click/tap the source root folder under **[!UICONTROL Language Copies]** for which you already created a languag copy, and then click/tap **[!UICONTROL Reveal in Assets]** to open the folder in [!DNL Experience Manager] Assets.

   ![chlimage_1-99](assets/chlimage_1-99.png)

1. From the Assets UI, select an asset you already translated and click/tap the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** icon from the toolbar to open the asset in edit mode.

   ![chlimage_1-100](assets/chlimage_1-100.png)

1. Edit the asset and then save the changes.
1. Perform steps 2-14 of the [Add to existing translation project](#add-to-existing-translation-project) procedure to update the language copy.
1. Click/tap the ellipsis at the bottom of the **[!UICONTROL Translation Job]** tile. From the list of assets in the **[!UICONTROL Translation Job]** page, you can clearly view the temporary location where the translated version of the asset is stored.

   ![chlimage_1-101](assets/chlimage_1-101.png)

1. Select the checkbox next to **[!UICONTROL Title]**.
1. From the toolbar, click/tap **[!UICONTROL Accept Translation]** and then click/tap **[!UICONTROL Accept]** in the dialog to overwrite the translated asset in the target folder with the translated version of the edited asset.

   ![chlimage_1-102](assets/chlimage_1-102.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To enable the translation workflow to update the destination asset(s), accept both the asset and metadata.

   Click/tap **[!UICONTROL Reject Translation]** to retain the originally translated version of the asset in the target locale root and reject the edited version.

   ![chlimage_1-103](assets/chlimage_1-103.png)
