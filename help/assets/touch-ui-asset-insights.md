# Asset Insights {#asset-insights}

Learn how the Asset Insights feature lets you track user ratings and usage statistics of assets that are used in third-party websites, marketing campaigns, and Adobe's creative solutions.

The Asset Insights feature enables you to track user ratings and usage statistics of assets that are used in third-party websites, marketing campaigns, and Adobe's creative solutions to derive insights regarding their performance and popularity.

Assets Insights captures user activity details, such as the number of times an asset is rated, clicked, and impressions (number of times the asset is loaded on the website). It assigns scores to assets based on these statistics. You can use the scores and performance statistics to select popular assets for inclusion in catalogs, marketing campaigns, and so on. You can even formulate archival and license renewal policies for assets based on these statistics.

For Assets Insights to capture usage statistics for assets from a website, you must include the embed code for the asset in the website code.

To let Asset Insights display usage statistics for assets, first configure the feature to fetch reporting data from [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. For details, see [Configure Asset Insights](touch-ui-configuring-asset-insights.md).

   Usage score describes the numbers of times asset is used in various solutions.

   The **[!UICONTROL Impressions]** score is the number of times the asset is loaded on the web site. The number displayed under **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** is the number of times the asset is clicked.

1. Review the **[!UICONTROL Usage Statistics]** section to know which entities the asset was part of and which creative solutions recently used it. The higher the usage, the greater the chances that the asset is popular among users. Usage data is displayed under the following heads:

    * **[!UICONTROL Asset]**: The number of times the asset was part of a collection or compound asset
    * **[!UICONTROL Web & Mobile]**: The number of times the asset was part of websites and apps
    * **[!UICONTROL Social]**: The number of times the asset was used in solutions, such as Adobe Social and Adobe Campaign
    * **[!UICONTROL Email]**: The number of times the asset was used in email campaigns
