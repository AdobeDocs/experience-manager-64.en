Learn how to use the Watermarking feature to add a digital watermark to assets.

The Watermarking feature in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets lets you add a digital watermark to assets, which helps users verify the authenticity and copyright ownership of the assets. AEM Assets supports text to be used as a watermark on PNG and JPEG files.

To be able to apply watermark on assets, add the Watermark step in the DAM Update Asset workflow.

1. Tap/click the AEM logo, and go to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Workflow]** > **[!UICONTROL Models]**.
1. From the Workflow Models page, select the **[!UICONTROL DAM Update Asset]** workflow and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.  

1. From the Side Panel, drag the **[!UICONTROL Add Watermark]** step to the DAM Update Asset workflow.

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Add Watermark]** step to display its properties.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Arguments]** tab, specify valid values in the various fields, including text, font type, size, color, position, orientation, and so on. To confirm the changes, tap/click the Done icon.
