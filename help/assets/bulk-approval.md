# Review folder assets and collections {#review-folder-assets-and-collections}

Set up review workflows for assets within a folder or a collection and share it with reviewers or creative partners to seek feedback.

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets lets you set up an ad-hoc review workflow for assets within a folder or collection, and share it with reviewers or creative partners to seek feedback.

You can either associate the review workflow with a project or create an independent review task.

After you share the assets, reviewers can approve or reject them. Notifications are sent at various stages of the workflow to notify intended recipients regarding the completion of various tasks. For example, when you share a folder or collection, the reviewer receives a notification that a folder/collection has been shared for review.

After the reviewer completes the review (approves or rejects assets), you receive a review completion notification.
