# Asset Templates {#asset-templates}

Asset templates are a special class of assets that facilitate quick re-purposing of visually-rich content for digital and print media. An asset template includes two parts, the fixed messaging section and the editable section.

The fixed messaging section can contain proprietary content, such as brand logo and copyright information that are disabled for editing. The editable section can contain visual and textual content in fields that can be edited to customize messaging.

The flexibility to make limited edits while securing global signages makes asset templates ideal building blocks for quick content adaptation and distribution as content artifacts for various functions. Repurposing content helps reduce the cost for managing print and digital channels and deliver holistic and consistent experiences across these channels.

As a marketer, you can store and manage templates within AEM Assets and use a single base template to create multiple personalized print experiences with ease. You can create various types of marketing collateral, including brochures, flyers, postcards, business cards, and so on to lucidly convey your marketing message to customers. You can also assemble multi-page print outputs from existing or new print outputs. Above all, you can simultaneously deliver both digital and print experiences with ease to provide a consistent, integrated experience for users.

While asset templates are mostly InDesign files, proficiency in InDesign is not a barrier to creating stellar artifacts. You need not map the fields of your InDesign template with your product fields that you otherwise require to when creating catalogs. You can edit the templates in WYSIWYG mode directly on the web interface. However, for InDesign to process your editing changes, you must first configure AEM Assets to integrate with InDesign server.

The ability to edit InDesign templates from the web interface helps foster greater collaboration between Creative and Marketing personnel, while reducing the time to market for local promotion initiatives.

You can do the following with asset templates:

* Modify editable template fields from the web interface
* Control the basic styling of text, for example font size, style, and type at the tag level
* Change images within the template using Content Picker
* Preview template edits
* Merge multiple template files to create a multi-page artifact

When you choose a template for your collateral, AEM Assets creates a copy of the template that you can edit. The original template is preserved, which ensures that your global signage remains intact and can be reused to enforce brand consistency.

You can export the updated file within the parent folder in the following formats:

* INDD
* PDF
* JPG

You can also download the output in these formats to your local system.

   >* Images are linked from the local file system

   >
   >* Embed images while creating InDesign templates (See [About links and embedded graphics](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/graphics-links.html)).
