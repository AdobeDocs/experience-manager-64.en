Learn about Lightbox in [!DNL Experience Manager] Assets.

Lightbox is a special type of collection that provides easy access to assets. You can quickly access Lightbox to add or delete assets. It serves as your personal image gallery.

If you are an Adobe Experience Manager Assets user, Lightbox is automatically created when you first log in to the application. It is exclusive to your login. Other users cannot access your Lightbox.

## Adding assets to lightbox {#adding-assets-to-lightbox}

1. Drag the assets to the **[!UICONTROL Drop in Lightbox]** zone. Release when the Dropzone becomes active, and its label changes to **[!UICONTROL Drop to Add]**.
