>To be able to create a private folder, you require Read and Edit ACL permissions on the parent folder under which you want to create a private folder. If you are not an administrator, these permissions are not enabled for you by default on */content/dam*. In this case, first obtain these permissions for your user ID/group before attempting to create private folders or view folder settings.
