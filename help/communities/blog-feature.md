# Blog Feature {#blog-feature}

## Introduction {#introduction}

The blog feature for AEM Communities has transformed from an authoring activity to a true community activity that takes place in the publish environment.

The blog feature supports providing community information in a journaling format. Blog entries are made in the publish environment by authorized members (registered, signed-in users).

The blog feature provides:

* Publish-side creation of blog articles and comments
* Rich text editing
* Inline images (with support for drag and drop)
* Embedded social networking content ([oEmbed support](blog-developer-basics.md#allowing-rich-media))
* Draft mode
* Scheduled publishing
* Compose on-behalf (a [privileged member](users.md#privileged-members-group) can create content on behalf of a different communty member)
* [In-context and bulk moderation](moderate-ugc.md) of blog articles and comments

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the blog feature to an AEM site
* Configuration settings for blog components

>[!NOTE]
>
>The components `Journal`and `Journal Sidebar` are titled `Blog` and `Blog Sidebar`. 
>
>The blog feature found in AEM 6.0 and earlier releases is now removed. It was based on a template and only allowed authors to create content in the author environment.

## Adding Blog Components to a Page {#adding-blog-components-to-a-page}

If it is desired to add a blog to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate

* `Communities / Blog`
* `Communities / Blog Sidebar`

And drag them into place on a page where the blog should appear.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](blog-developer-basics.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Blog`component will appear:
