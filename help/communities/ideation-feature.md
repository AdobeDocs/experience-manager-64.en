## Introduction {#introduction}

The ideation feature provides an area for signed-in site visitors (community members) in the publish environment to:

* Create ideas to share with the community
* View and comment on ideas
* Follow an idea
* Vote on an idea

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the ideation feature to an AEM site
* Configuration settings for the Ideation component

## Adding a Ideation to a Page {#adding-a-ideation-to-a-page}

To add a `Ideation` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate `Communities / Ideation` and drag it into place on a page where the idea should appear.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](ideation.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Ideation`component will appear:
