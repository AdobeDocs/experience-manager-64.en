# Activity Trends {#activity-trends}

## Introduction {#introduction}

The `Community Activity List` component provides the ability to add trending information regarding posts and views by members as well as posts and views of content.

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the `Community Activity List` component to a [community site](overview.md#community-sites)

* Configuration settings for the `Community Activity List` component

## Requirement {#requirement}

Data for the `Community Activity List` is only available when Adobe Analytics is licensed and configured for the community site.

See [Analytics Configuration for Communities Features](analytics.md).

## Adding a Community Activity List to a Page {#adding-a-community-activity-list-to-a-page}

To add a `Community Activity List` component to a page in author mode, locate the component `Communities / Community Activity List` and drag it into place on a page.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When first placed on a page of a community site, this is how the component appears:

  Default is no title.

  Default is 10.

* **[!UICONTROL Activity type]**

  * `Likes`

  Default is Views.

* **[!UICONTROL Time period]**

  Select one of
  * `Last 24 hours`

  * `Last 90 days`
  * `This year (since Jan 1st)`
  * `Total`

  Default is `Total`.

* **[!UICONTROL Context path]**

  Provides the ability to scope the activity to a subset of the site, such as a specific Blog.

  Default is the entire community site.

* **[!UICONTROL Member count aggregation]**

  When unchecked (turned off), only top-level posts are counted. For example, if the context is the root page (the default), then an `Activity Type`of `Posts`will never show any activity as there is no ability to post content to the root page. When checked, the counts on all descendant pages are included.

  Default is checked.
