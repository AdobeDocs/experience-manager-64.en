## Introduction {#introduction}

The `Leaderboard` component provides the ability to obtain a sense of how members are interacting within the community by ranking members according to points earned (basic scoring) or their expertise (advanced scoring).

Prior to including the leaderboard component on a page, it is necessary to configure [Communities Scoring and Badges](implementing-scoring.md).

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the `Leaderboard` component to a [community site](overview.md#community-sites)

* Configuration settings for the `Leaderboard` component

## Adding a Leaderboard to a Page {#adding-a-leaderboard-to-a-page}

To add a `Leaderboard` component to a page in author mode, locate the component

* `Communities / Leaderboard`

and drag it into place on a page.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When first placed on a page of a community site, this is how the component appears:
