# Activity Streams Feature {#activity-streams-feature}

>[CAUTION]
>
>AEM 6.4 has reached the end of extended support and this documentation is no longer updated. For further details, see our [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the supported versions [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/).

## Introduction {#introduction}

The activities of a signed in community member, such as posting to a forum or blog, are collected into a stream which may be filtered and displayed in various ways through configuration of the `Activity Streams` component.

The ability to follow adds another view of activities when community members follow postings of interest or follow the activities of other community members.

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the Activity Streams component to an AEM site
* Configuration settings for Activity Streams component

## Adding Activity Streams to a Page {#adding-activity-streams-to-a-page}

If it is desired to add an `Activity Streams` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate

* `Communities / Activity Streams`

and drag it into place on a page where activity streams should appear.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](essentials-activities.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Activity Streams` component will appear:

* **[!UICONTROL Max number of activities]** 
  The number of activities to display
* **[!UICONTROL Stream Resource Path]** 
  Leave blank to default to the community site or community group. The stream resource path identifies the source of activities. Default is blank.
* **[!UICONTROL Display User Activities View]** 
  if checked, the activities page will include a tab which filters activities based on those generated within the community by the current member. Default is checked.
* **[!UICONTROL Display All Activities View]** 
  If checked, the activities page will include a tab which includes all activities generated within the community to which the current member has access. Default is checked.
* **[!UICONTROL Display Following View]** 
  If checked, the activities page will include a tab which filters activities based on those the current member is following. Default is checked.

## Following View {#following-view}

Components must be configured to enable following. Features that allow following are [blog](blog-feature.md), [forum](forum.md), [QnA](working-with-qna.md), [calendar](calendar.md), [filelibrary](file-library.md), and [comments](comments.md).

![chlimage_1-198](assets/chlimage_1-198.png)

The **Follow** button provides a means to follow entries as activities, [notifications](notifications.md), and/or [subscriptions](subscriptions.md). Each time the **Follow** button is selected, it is possible to toggle on or off a selection. The `Email Subscriptions` selection is only present when configured.

If any method of following is selected, the text of the button changes to **Following**. For convenience, it is possible to select `Unfollow All` to toggle off all methods.

The **Follow** button will appear:

* When viewing another member's profile
* On a main feature page, such as forums, QnA, and blogs
  * Follows all activity for that general feature

* For a specific entry, such as a forum topic, QnA question, or blog article
  * Follows all activity for that specific entry

## Additional Information {#additional-information}

More information may be found on the [Activity Streams Essentials](essentials-activities.md) page for developers.
