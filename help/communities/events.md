# OSGi Events for Communities Components {#osgi-events-for-communities-components}

## Overview {#overview}

When members interact with Communities features, OSGi events are sent that can trigger asynchronous listeners, like notifications or gamification (scoring and badging).

A component's [SocialEvent](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/cq/social/scf/core/SocialEvent.html) instance records the events as `actions`that occur for a `topic`. The SocialEvent includes a method to return a `verb`associated with the action. There is an *n-1* relationship between `actions`and `verbs`.

For the Communities components delivered in the release, the following tables describe the `verbs`defined for each `topic`available for use.

## Events for Custom Components {#events-for-custom-components}

For a custom component, the [SocialEvent abstract class](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/cq/social/scf/core/SocialEvent.html) must be extended d to record the component's events as `actions`that occur for a `topic`.

The custom event would override the method `getVerb()` so that an appropriate `verb`is returned for each `action`. The `verb` returned for an action may be one commonly used (such as `POST`) or one specialized for the component (such as `ADD RATING`). There is an *n-1* relationship between `actions`and `verbs`.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ensure a custom extension is registered with a ranking lower than any existing implementation in the product.

## Sample EventListener to Filter Activity Stream Data {#sample-eventlistener-to-filter-activity-stream-data}

It is possible to listen to events for the purpose of modifying what appears in the activity stream.

The following pseudo-code sample will remove DELETE events for Comments component from the activity stream.

### Pseudo-code for EventListener {#pseudo-code-for-eventlistener}

Requires [latest feature pack](deploy-communities.md#latestfeaturepack).

```java

    @Activate
    public void activate(final ComponentContext ctx) {
        ranking = PropertiesUtil.toInteger(ctx.getProperties().get("ranking"), 10);
    }

    @Modified
    public void update(final Map<String, Object> props) {
        ranking = PropertiesUtil.toInteger(props.get("ranking"), 10);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean evaluate(final SocialEvent<?> evt, final Resource resource) {
        if (evt.getAction() != null && evt.getAction() instanceof SocialEvent.SocialActions) {
            final SocialEvent.SocialActions action = evt.getAction();
            if (StringUtils.equals(action.getVerb(), CommentActions.DELETED.getVerb())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, ? extends Object> getActivityProperties(final SocialEvent<?> arg0, final Resource arg1) {
        return Collections.<String, Object>emptyMap();
    }

    @Override

    @Override

    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, ? extends Object> getObjectProperties(final SocialEvent<?> arg0, final Resource arg1) {
        return Collections.<String, Object>emptyMap();
    }

    /* Ensure a custom extension is registered with a ranking lower than any existing implementation in the product. */
    @Override
    public int getRanking() {
        return this.ranking;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, ? extends Object> getTargetProperties(final SocialEvent<?> arg0, final Resource arg1) {
        return Collections.<String, Object>emptyMap();
    }

    @Override
    public String[] getStreamProviderPid() {

    }

}
