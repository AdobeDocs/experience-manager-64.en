# Reports Console {#reports-console}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>AEM 6.4 has reached the end of extended support and this documentation is no longer updated. For further details, see our [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the supported versions [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/).

## Overview {#overview}

For AEM Communities, there are various reports that may be accessed in several ways from the author environment.

In general, the various reports are:

* [Assignments Report](#assignments-report) - for an [enablement community](overview.md#enablement-community), provides an overview of learners' progress on their assignments, including an associated score if implementing the SCORM standard
* [Views Report](#views-report) - provides a chart of views of content by community members and site visitors for any community site
* [Posts Report](#posts-report) - provides a chart of various types of posts by community members to any community site

When [Adobe Analytics is enabled](sites-console.md#analytics), reports will include the number of views, plays, comments and ratings for each enablement resource over time

Tabular reports can be exported in .csv format for subsequent processing.
