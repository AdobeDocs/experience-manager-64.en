# Forum Feature {#forum-feature}

## Introduction {#introduction}

The forum feature provides an area for signed-in site visitors (community members) in the publish environment to:

* Create new topics
* View and reply to topics
* Follow a topic
* Search a forum
* Help moderate the forum content
* Move forum topics from one page to another

This section of the documentation describes

* Adding the forum feature to an AEM site
* Configuration settings for the `Forum`component

## Adding a Forum to a Page {#adding-a-forum-to-a-page}

To add a `Forum` component to a page in author mode, use the component browser to locate

* `Communities / Forum`

And drag it into place on a page where the forum should appear.

For necessary information, visit [Communities Components Basics](basics.md).

When the [required client-side libraries](essentials-forum.md#essentials-for-client-side) are included, this is how the `Forum`component will appear:
