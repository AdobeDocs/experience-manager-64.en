# Quick Guide to Authoring Pages{#quick-guide-to-authoring-pages}

These procedures are intended as a quick guide (high-level) to the key actions of authoring page content in AEM.

They:

* Are not intended as comprehensive coverage.
* Provide links to the detailed documentation.

For full details about authoring with AEM see:

* [First Steps for Authors](/help/sites-authoring/first-steps.md)  
* [Working with the Author Environment](/help/sites-authoring/author-environment-tools.md)

## A Few Quick Hints {#a-few-quick-hints}

Before giving the overview of specifics, here is a small collection of general tips and hints that are worth bearing in mind, especially if you are used to the [classic UI authoring environment](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui.md).

### Sites Console {#sites-console}

* **Create**

  * This button is available in many consoles - the options presented are context sensitive so can vary according to the scenario.

* Re-ordering pages in a folder

  * This can be done in [List View](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#list-view). The changes will be applied and be visible in other views.

* Changing your UI

  * This can be done from various locations. See [Selecting your UI](/help/sites-authoring/select-ui.md).

### Page Authoring {#page-authoring}

* Navigating Links

  * ***Links are not available for navigation*** when you are in **Edit** mode. To navigate with links you need to [preview the page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#previewing-pages) using either:

    * [Preview Mode](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#preview-mode)
    * [View as Published](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#view-as-published)

* Workflows and Versions are no longer started/created from the page editor; this is now done from [Timeline](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#timeline) (accessible from the console).

>[!NOTE]

>There are a number of keyboard shortcuts that can make the authoring experience easier.

>* [Keyboard Shortcuts for Consoles](/help/sites-authoring/keyboard-shortcuts.md)  

## Finding Your Page {#finding-your-page}

1. Open the **Sites** console (using the **Sites** option in the [Global Navigation](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#global-navigation) - this is triggered (drop down) when you select the Adobe Experience Manager link (top left).  

1. Navigate down the tree by tapping/clicking on the appropriate page. How the page resources are represented depends on the view you are using - [Card, List, or Column](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources):

   ![screen_shot_2018-03-21at160214](assets/screen_shot_2018-03-21at160214.png)

1. Navigate up the tree using [the breadcrumb in the header](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#the-header), which allows you to return to the selected location:

   ![chlimage_1-95](assets/chlimage_1-95.png)

### Creating a New Page {#creating-a-new-page}

1. [Navigate to the location](#finding-your-page) where you want to create the new page.
1. Use the **Create** icon and then select **Page** from the list:

   ![screen_shot_2018-03-21at160324](assets/screen_shot_2018-03-21at160324.png)

1. This opens the wizard that will guide you through collecting the information needed when [creating your new page](/help/sites-authoring/managing-pages.md#creating-a-new-page). Follow the on screen instructions.

## Selecting Your Page for Further Action {#selecting-your-page-for-further-action}

You can select a page so that you can take action on it. Selecting a page will automatically update the toolbar so that the actions relevant to that resource are shown.

How to select a page depends on which view you are using in the console:

1. Card View:

   * Enter selection mode by [selecting the required resource](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#viewing-and-selecting-resources) with:

     * Mobile device: tap-and-hold
     * Desktop: the [quick action](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#quick-actions) - tick icon:

       ![screen_shot_2018-03-21at160503](assets/screen_shot_2018-03-21at160503.png)

     * The card will be overlaid with a tick to show that the page has been selected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Once in selection mode the **Select** icon (a tick) will change to the **Deselect** icon (a cross).

1. List View:

   * Tap/click on the thumbnail for the required resource - the thumbnail will be overlaid with a tick to show that it has been selected.

1. Column View:

   * Tap/click on the thumbnail for the required resource - the thumbnail will be overlaid with a tick to show that it has been selected.

## Quick Actions (Card View/Desktop Only) {#quick-actions-card-view-desktop-only}

1. [Navigate to the page](#finding-your-page) you want to take action on.
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the card that represents your required resource; the quick actions will be shown:

## Locking Your Page (then Unlocking) {#locking-your-page-then-unlocking}

[Locking a page](/help/sites-authoring/editing-content.md#locking-a-page) prevents other authors from working on it while you are. The Lock (and Unlock) icon/button can be found:
