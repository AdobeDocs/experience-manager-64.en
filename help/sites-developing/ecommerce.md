# eCommerce{#ecommerce}

The integration framework includes an integration layer with an API. This allows you to:

* plug in an eCommerce system and pull product data into AEM
* build AEM components for commerce capabilities independent of the specific eCommerce engine

For more information, see:

* [Developing (generic)](/help/sites-developing/generic.md)
* [Developing with SAP Commerce Cloud](/help/sites-developing/sap-commerce-cloud.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Since the eCommerce framework can be used with any eCommerce solution, see [Developing (generic)](/help/sites-developing/generic.md) for more information about developing possibilities with Intershop, Elastic Path or IBM Websphere Commerce.
