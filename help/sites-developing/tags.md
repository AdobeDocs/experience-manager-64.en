* See [Using Tags](/help/sites-authoring/tags.md) for information about tagging content.

The following information is available for developers :

* [AEM Tagging Framework](/help/sites-developing/framework.md) - A description of the nodes and properties used for tagging

* [Building Tagging into an AEM Application](/help/sites-developing/building.md) - A description of the APIs that work with the tagging framework from client side and server side code
