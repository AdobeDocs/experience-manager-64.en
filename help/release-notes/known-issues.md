### Installation and deployment

* (AEM Forms JEE only) When boostrapping JBoss application server while running Configuration Manager returns EJB invocation and bootstrap failure errors. However, you can ignore them. (Ref# CQ-4229793)
* When AEM Forms is started, the `SAX Security Manager could not be setup` warning appears. (CQ-4297403)

* The Agent UI takes a while to load Interactive Communications that include chart or image elements. (CQ-4236630)
* The data display format in print preview is dd-mm-yyyy while in the web preview is `dd-mmm-yy` (CQ-4237045)  
* The Interactive Communication Web channel supports only ordered and unordered lists. In list document fragments, compound listing and indentation are not supported for Web channel of the Interactive Communication. (CQ-4233672)
* The following issues are observed when web channel syncs with print channel:

  * Web channel take a while to sync when switching from print channel for the first time.
  * Web channel does not sync if the print channel includes an unconfigured chart component. To resolve the issue, delete the chart component and sync again.
  * Sync sometimes fails with the "An error occurred while synchronizing the Live Copy" error. To resolve the issue, refresh the page.
  * The static text in a layout fragment is replaced with table cell name when the first column in the table is a header column in the print channel template.
  * Cannot add components or assets at any location other than at the bottom of a web channel communication. To place it at another location, add a panel at the bottom of web channel and reorder using the content tree.
  * Can move content into inherited target area of web channel without removing the live copy inheritance.

(CQ-4239780)

    wsdlauthenticationsettings/items/fixedcolumns/items/container/items/wsdl/items/  
    selectAuthentication/items/custom.  
    1. Update the value of the value property to the same as the value of the text property.  
    1. Click Save All to save the configuration.

(CQ-4238462)

### Acrobat Sign integration

* Acrobat Sign scheduler stops working intermittently and therefore forms pending sign do not move to submission. To resolve the issue, restart the **Apache Sling Scheduler Support** bundle from AEM web console at https://[*server*]:[*port*]/system/console/bundles.

### Adaptive Forms authoring

* The Chart component in adaptive forms takes more space than it normally does.
* An exception is returned when saving properties for adaptive forms, adaptive form fragments, or interactive communications in Forms Manager UI.
* The specified maximum number of characters for an adaptive form text box is not honored on Android 6.0 Samsung devices. (Ref# CQ-4235205)
* When you submit a form containing a standard HTML upload field from an Apple iOS device, sometimes, the content of the file is not sent and a 0-byte file is received at the other end. Apple iOS 15.1 provides a fix for the issue.
