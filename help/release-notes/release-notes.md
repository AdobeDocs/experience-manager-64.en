## What's new {#what-s-new}

Adobe Experience Manager 6.4 is an upgrade release to the Adobe Experience Manager 6.3 code base. It provides new and enhanced functionality, key customer fixes, high priority customer enhancements and general bug fixes oriented toward product stabilization. It also includes the majority of all Adobe Experience Manager 6.3 feature packs, hot fix, and service pack releases.

The list below provides an overview - while the subsequent pages list the full details.

### Experience Manager Foundation {#experience-manager-foundation}

Full list of changes in [AEM Foundation](wcm-platform.md).

The platform of Adobe Experience Manager 6.4 build on top of updated versions of the OSGi-based framework (Apache Sling and Apache Felix) and the Java Content Repository: Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.8.2.

The Quickstart uses Eclipse Jetty 9.3.22 as servlet engine.

#### User Interface {#user-interface}

Various enhancements have been made to the UI to make it more productive and easier to use.

* [New Content Tree rail](/help/sites-authoring/basic-handling.md#content-tree) to quickly navigate a hierarchy. In combination with the list view, this restores the Classic UI interaction model.
* Improved scrolling experience in card and list view of large folders.
* [Improved interaction with the search results](/help/sites-authoring/search.md) - the back button restores the prior search result.
* [Additional keyboard shortcuts](/help/sites-authoring/keyboard-shortcuts.md), for most common actions, such as to open a particular rail, to edit, move and delete item, or to open properties.
* [Ability to disable keyboard shortcuts](/help/sites-authoring/user-properties.md) (enable/disable in Preferences).
* [Stop showing time stamps across all UI](/help/sites-authoring/user-properties.md) relative after 7 days (set default in Preferences).

See the [Authoring documentation](/help/sites-authoring/home.md) for more information on these features.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Adobe does not plan to make further enhancements to the Classic UI. AEM 6.4 has the Classic UI included, and customers upgrading from earlier releases can keep using it as is. Note that Classic UI remains fully supported while being deprecated. [Read more](/help/sites-deploying/ui-recommendations.md).

#### Content Repository {#content-repository}

* Faster and more efficient compaction by Online Revision Cleanup. Internal tests show that the new tail compaction is up to 10 times faster and can reclaim more disk space with less IOPS compared to AEM 6.3. This results in less performance impact while the Online Revision Cleanup is running. For more information, please see [the documentation page](/help/sites-deploying/revision-cleanup.md#full-and-tail-compaction-modes).

* Continuous Revision Cleanup for MongoMK replaces scheduled cleanup maintenance
* Improved efficiency for Revision Cleanup on Document Nodestores

#### Search & Indexing {#search-indexing}

* Enhanced support for Indexing Operations via oak-run (CLI):

  * Index consistency check
  * Indexing statistics
  * Index configuration import or export
  * Reindexing

* Reduced Lucene related repository growth for an overall improved system performance

For more information, please visit [this documentation page](/help/sites-deploying/indexing-via-the-oak-run-jar.md).

#### Monitoring {#monitoring}

* A new [System Overview](/help/sites-administering/operations-dashboard.md#system-overview) provides a snapshot view on all performance-related system status and activities.
* A new set of [Health Checks](/help/sites-administering/operations-dashboard.md#health-checks) around Indexing, Queries and Maintenance

#### Projects and Workflows {#projects-and-workflows}

* All-new [Workflow Editor to create and edit workflow models](/help/sites-developing/workflows-models.md).

#### Upgrade from earlier version {#upgrade-from-earlier-version}

* [Backward Compatibility](/help/sites-deploying/backward-compatibility.md): Backward compatible features in 6.4, helps your custom code remain compatible in most cases and reduces upgrade effort.
* [Upgrade Complexity Assessment](/help/sites-deploying/pattern-detector.md): New Pattern Detector tool to assess the complexity of your upgrades, before you upgrade.
* [Repository Restructuring](/help/sites-deploying/repository-restructuring.md): significant restructuring (primarily /etc) to facilitate easier upgrades and promote implementation best practices
* For more general information regarding Upgrades, please see the [this page](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md) for more details.

### Experience Manager Sites {#experience-manager-sites}

Full list of changes in [AEM Sites and Add-ons](sites.md).

#### Fluid Experiences {#fluid-experiences}

The introduction of Fluid Experiences at the start of 2017, backed by Content Fragments, Experience Fragments and Content Services were the start to evolve to a multi-channel-first content management. AEM 6.4 extends each of the areas significantly:

**[Content Fragments](/help/assets/content-fragments.md)**

New in 6.4 are a visual [content model](/help/assets/content-fragments-models.md) editor and a new [configurable component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/components/content-fragment-component.html) to provide flexible HTML output and JSON to include in Content Services.

**Experience Fragments**

Creating variations in a fragment with the same content but different layout is now more efficient, thanks to the Building Blocks capability. On top of sending Experience Fragments to Facebook and Pinterest, now it's possible to send them to Adobe Target as offer.

**Content Services**

Various enhancements to Sling Model Exporter and the Core Components are included to provide a robust JSON output to embed content in mobile apps and experiences build with single-page apps.

#### Getting Sites Built Quicker {#gettings-sites-built-quicker}

AEM 6.4 completes the transformation to the next generation component model. The Core Components concept introduced in AEM 6.3, and now joined by the Style System, provides an efficient way to build new and extend existing sites.

Recommended tutorial to learn on how to best leverage the new component model: [Getting Started with AEM Sites - WKND Tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/overview.html)

### Leverage Customer Focused Development {#leverage-customer-focused-development}

Adobe is using a customer focused development model that allows customers to contribute to all stages of the development process, during specification, development and testing. Our thanks goes to all contributing customers and partners in this process.

Adobe has the procedures and processes in place to enable collection, prioritization, and tracking of customer focused bug resolution and enhancement request development. The [Adobe Marketing Cloud Support Portal](https://helpx.adobe.com/contact/enterprise-support.ec.html) is integrated with the Adobe Enhancement & Defect Tracking System. Customer questions are identified and resolved with Customer Care where possible. When escalated to R&D, all customer information is captured, and used for prioritization and reporting purposes. Priority is given in development to paid support and warrantee issues and paid customer enhancements.

This process of prioritization has yielded more than 500 customer focused changes fixed in AEM 6.4.
