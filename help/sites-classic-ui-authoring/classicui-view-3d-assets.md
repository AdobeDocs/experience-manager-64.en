# Viewing 3D assets{#viewing-d-assets}

The interactive 3D viewer is available from the asset details page in AEM. The viewer includes, among other things, a collection of interactive camera controls that let you orbit, zoom, and pan the 3D asset.

Besides using the default stages in AEM 3D, you can also use stages that you have created in a third-party application and uploaded into AEM.

See [About the use of stages in AEM 3D](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui-stages-aem3d.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>To view a 3D asset, your device or desktop browser must be WebGL-enabled. Also, the underlying graphics hardware must have sufficient capabilities and memory to render models of the desired size.

## Performance considerations when you view 3D assets {#performance-considerations-when-you-view-d-assets}

The time it takes to open a 3D asset in the asset details page view depends on several factors. These factors include such things as the following:

* Bandwidth and latencies to the server.
* Model size (number of faces).
* Number and size of maps.
* Complexity of the stage. For example, the size of the IBL image.

In addition, the capabilities of the client computer-such as a workstation, notebook, or mobile touch device-are also important to consider when you manipulate the camera interactively. A reasonably powerful system with good graphics capabilities can make the interactive 3D viewing experience smoother and more favorable.

**To view 3D assets**:

1. Make sure you have uploaded 3D assets into AEM. 

   See [About the uploading and processing of 3D assets in AEM](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui-upload-proc-3d.md).
1. From **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager]**, on the **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** page, tap **[!UICONTROL Assets]**.
1. Near the upper-right corner of the page, from the **[!UICONTROL View]** drop-down list, tap **[!UICONTROL Card View]**.

1. Navigate to a 3D asset that you want to view.
1. Tap the card of the 3D asset to open it in the asset details page.

1. Do any of the following:

    * In the lower-right corner of the asset details page, use the camera control palette to change various views of the asset. 

      If you use a non-touch input device without a scroll wheel, such as a classic Apple single-button mouse, you can still change the zoom or perspective of a 3D asset, while in each respective mode. You accomplish the action by pressing and holding down the `SHIFT`key while depressing the mouse button and dragging up or down. 

      When using a touch pad on a typical notebook computer, it is often difficult to control the zoom or perspective behaviors with the two-finger gesture. In such cases, you can press and hold down `SHIFT`during the action. This kind of effort reduces the velocity of the pinch gesture and makes it easier to achieve the exact zoom level or perspective that you want. Alternately, you can use a one finger drag up or down while the `SHIFT`key is pressed to affect zoom or perspective behaviors.

      <td><strong>Camera control name</strong><br /> </td>

      <td><p>Tap or click to toggle between Zoom and Perspective modes.</p> <p>Or, press and hold down the <code>ALT/OPTION</code> key during the action to temporarily toggle to Perspective<br /> mode. Release the key to revert to Zoom mode.</p> 
        <ul> 
        <li><strong>Zoom</strong>-Dolly in and out behavior which moves the camera closer or further away from the asset<br /> that you are viewing. Zoom is the default behavior for the scroll wheel on a mouse (if available0, for two-finger pinch gestures on mobile devices, or when you hold down the Shift key while dragging up or down using the left mouse button.</li> 
        <li><strong>Perspective</strong>-Changes the focal length (also known as field-of-view) of the camera while maintaining the relative size of the asset in the view. Perspective is the alternate behavior for the scroll wheel (if available), for two-finger pinch gestures on mobile devices, or when you hold down the Shift key while dragging up or down using the left mouse button.</li>

        <ul> 
        <li><strong>Orbit</strong>- Moves the viewing camera on a sphere centered on a target point which is located near the center of the 3D asset be default. Orbit is the default behavior for a left-button drag or a single touch drag on mobile devices.</li> 
        <li><strong>Pan</strong>-Moves the camera in the viewing plane. The target point is moved correspondingly, so subsequent orbit actions will move the camera around a new target point. Pan is the alternate behavior for the left-button drag and single touch drag.</li>

        <li><strong>Examine</strong>-Tap or click to enter Target mode.</li> 
        <li><strong>Target</strong>-Tap or click a point anywhere on the 3D asset to center the view on that part of the asset.<br /> Orbit actions use the new target point.</li>

      <td>Tap or click to restore the view target point to the center of the model. Reset also moves the camera<br /> closer or further away to show the asset in its entirety and at a reasonable viewing size.</td>

1. Near the upper-right corner of the asset details page, tap the **[!UICONTROL Stage Selector]** icon. Select a stage name with the background and lighting that you want to apply to the 3D asset.

   ![](do-not-localize/chlimage_1-2.png)

   Stages provide the environment-background, ground plane, and lighting-in which the 3D model is viewed. 

   See [About the use of stages in AEM 3D](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui-stages-aem3d.md).

1. Near the upper-right corner of the asset details page, tap the **[!UICONTROL Camera Selector]** icon, then select a camera view that you want to apply to the 3D asset.

   ![](do-not-localize/chlimage_1-3.png)

   Stages often provide pre-defined cameras. You can re-select the current camera to restore it to its pre-defined settings. 

   See [About the use of stages in AEM 3D](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui-stages-aem3d.md).

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Do one of the following:

    * Render the 3D asset. 
  
      See [Rendering 3D assets](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/classicui-rendering-3d.md).
  
    * In the upper-right corner of the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Close]** to return to the Assets page.
