![workflow_aem](assets/workflow_aem.png)

Let’s look at the reference site scenario in detail to understand how the AEM Forms helps We.Finance achieve their objectives.

### Sarah receives a newsletter from We.Finance and applies for a credit card {#sarah-receives-a-newsletter-from-we-finance-and-applies-for-a-credit-card}

Sarah Rose is an existing We.Finance customer. She receives a newsletter from We.Finance about new credit cards on offer. She finds the offers exciting and decides to apply for a credit card. She clicks the Apply Now button in the newsletter, which takes her to the credit card application on We.Finance portal. 

![marketing-email](assets/marketing-email.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works}

The newsletter sent to Sarah is a custom implementation that triggers an email to the specified email ID. The Apply Now button in the email is linked to the credit card application, which is an adaptive form on a publish instance.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself}

Open the following URL on the publish instance to trigger a newsletter email. Ensure that you replace `[emailID]` with a valid email account to receive the newsletter. Open the newsletter and click **[!UICONTROL Apply Now]** to go to the credit card application.

`https://[publishServer]:[publsihPort]/content/campaigns/we-finance/start.html?app=cc&email=[emailID]&givenName=Sarah&familyName=Rose`

### Sarah finds the offer interesting and chooses to apply {#sarah-finds-the-offer-interesting-and-chooses-to-apply}

Sarah decides to apply for the credit card and taps **[!UICONTROL Apply Now]** button on the email. It takes Sarah to the credit card application on We.Finance portal. The application form is organized in sections using a card layout.

Sarah selects a credit card from the available options and clicks **[!UICONTROL Continue]**.

![cc-application-form-desktop](assets/cc-application-form-desktop.png)

On the Personal Information page, as Sarah provides her Social Security Number, she gets a prompt to log in with her credentials.

![login-ssn](assets/login-ssn.png)

Sarah is an existing We.Finance customer. She logs in with her We.Finance account credentials and her personal details are auto-populated in the form. Sarah continues to fill the application form and that’s when a reminder pops up for a meeting she must attend. She clicks **[!UICONTROL Save my progress]** on the application form. It saves all the information Sarah has filled in so far and a dialog pops up to confirm if she would like to receive an email with a link to her draft application to complete later.

Sarah clicks **[!UICONTROL Send mail]**. She receives an email with a link to resume her credit card application.

![resume](assets/resume.png) 


<!--Theses sections used to be an accordion until converted to straight Markdown. When accordions are enabled, revert-->

### Sarah accesses the credit card application from her mobile device {#a-sarah-access}

If Sarah is accessing the credit card application from her mobile device, the responsive application opens in a view optimized for mobile devices. In this view, the application form is renders as one section at a time. It allows Sarah to view and provide information progressively as she navigates the application.

![form-on-mobile](assets/form-on-mobile.png)

### How it works {#a-how-it-works}

The **[!UICONTROL Apply Now]** button directs Sarah to the credit card application. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instances at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/cc-app.html`.

Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:

* It is based on an XSD schema.
* It is built using We Finance Theme A for styling and We.Finance template for layout. Also, it uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template at `https://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance` and the theme at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/we-finance-theme-a/jcr:content`.
* It includes adaptive form rules to invoke Form Data Model services to prefill user details of logged in user. It also invokes services to prefill information by social security number or email address provided in the form. You can review the Form Data Models and their services at `https://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm`.
* It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.
* It uses the Signature Step component to display the completed form and allows electronic signature on the form.
* The Save my progress button generates a unique ID for the user and saves the partially-filled application as a draft in a node in AEM repository. Also, it displays a dialog seeking permission to send an email with a link to the node containing the draft application. The Send mail button on the confirmation dialog triggers an email with a link to the node containing the draft.
* It uses the Invoke AEM Workflow submit action to trigger the credit card approval workflow. You can review the workflow used in this form at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/we-finance-credit-card-workflow.html`

It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.

Also, see the following documentation for more information about features used in the credit card application adaptive form:

* [Introduction to authoring adaptive forms](/help/forms/using/introduction-forms-authoring.md)
* [Creating adaptive forms using XML Schema](/help/forms/using/adaptive-form-xml-schema-form-model.md)
* [Rule Editor](/help/forms/using/rule-editor.md)
* [Themes](/help/forms/using/themes.md)
* [Data Integration](/help/forms/using/data-integration.md)

* [Forms-centric workflow on OSGi](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md)

### See it yourself {#a-see-it-yourself}

When logged in as Sarah Rose, click the **[!UICONTROL Apply now]** button on the credit card application. Fill in some details, explore various adaptive form components, and click **[!UICONTROL Save my progress]** to receive an email with a **[!UICONTROL Resume]** button that links to the draft application. Ensure that you specify your email ID in the application form to receive the email.

Review the We.Finance Theme available at:

`https://<host>:<AuthorPort>/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-Finance/we-Finance-Theme-A/jcr:content`

You can review the We.Finance Template at:

`https://<host>:<AuthorPort>/editor.html/conf/we-finance/settings/wcm/templates/we-finance-template/structure.html`

### Sarah resumes and submits the application {#sarah-resumes-and-submits-the-application}

Sarah comes back later and finds an email from We.Finance. She clicks the **[!UICONTROL Resume]** button in the email that takes her to her draft credit card application. The information that she filled earlier comes prepopulated. She fills the remaining application form, signs the application, and submits it.

![resume-1](assets/resume-1.png)

Alternatively, she can access her draft application under **[!UICONTROL My Forms]** on We.Finance home page.

![portal-drafts](assets/portal-drafts.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-1}

The Resume button in the email redirects Sarah to the node containing her draft application.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-1}

You must have received an email with a link to the draft application on your email ID that you specified while filling the application form. Go ahead, fill in the remaining sections in the application, and submit it.

### We.Finance receives and approves the application {#approving-the-application}

We.Finance receives the credit card application submitted by Sarah. A task is assigned to Gloria Rios. She reviews the task in her AEM Inbox and approves it.

![inbox](assets/inbox.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-2}

When Sarah fills and submits the credit card application, a Forms Workflow triggers and a task is created in Gloria's AEM inbox.

AEM Forms on OSGi provides forms-centric workflows that allow you to build adaptive forms-based workflows. These workflows can be used for review and approvals, business process flows, to start document services, integrate with Adobe Sign signature workflow, and so on. For more information, see [Forms-centric workflow on OSGi](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md).

The following image depicts the AEM workflow that processes the credit card application and generates a PDF output of the application.

![workflow](assets/workflow.png) 

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-2}

You can access AEM inbox for the we.finance site at https://<*hostname*>:<*PublishPort*>/content/we-finance/global/en.html. On the page, tap **[!UICONTROL Sign In]**, select the **[!UICONTROL Login as representative]** checkbox, log in to the AEM inbox using `grios/password` as the username/password for Gloria Rios, and approve the credit card application. For information about using AEM Inbox for forms-centric workflow tasks, see [Manage Forms applications and tasks in AEM Inbox](/help/forms/using/manage-applications-inbox.md).

![inbox-1](assets/inbox-1.png)

When you approve the application, Sarah receives an email with the welcome kit.

### Sarah receives the welcome kit and applies for an add-on card {#sarah-receives-the-welcome-kit-and-applies-for-an-add-on-card}

As Sarah's credit card application gets approved, she receives an email with a link to the Welcome kit. She opens the Welcome kit, which includes her credit card account details. The Welcome kit also displays promotional offers personalized for Sarah. As she scrolls down, the Welcome kit contains an embedded form to apply for an add-on card. Sarah quickly filled in the required details from within the Welcome kit and applies for the add-on card. A confirmation dialog for the add-on card application appears.

![welcome-kit-for-sara](assets/welcome-kit-for-sara.png)

The welcome kit is personalized for Sarah and shows information relevant to her. It provides her an option to download a PDF version of the welcome kit. 

![benefits-of-platinum-card](assets/benefits-of-platinum-card.png)

The welcome kit includes another application form that Sarah can fill and submit to apply for an add-on card from within the welcome kit without visiting the We.Finance portal.

![apply-addon-card](assets/apply-addon-card.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-3}

The welcome kit is an interactive communication included in the `cq-we-finance-content-pkg.zip` package. The interactive cards in the desktop version to showcase the benefits of the credit card in the welcome kit is a custom layout created using the default card layout of a document fragment.

The add-on card application is an embedded adaptive form in the welcome kit interactive communication.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-3}

Click the **[!UICONTROL Resume]** button in the email that you received in the previous step. It opens the draft application. Fill in all the details and submit the application. You will then receive a welcome kit. Review the welcome kit.

You can also view the welcome kit at the following URL:

https://&lt;*host*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/content/aemforms-refsite/doclink.html?document=/content/forms/af/we-finance/credit-card/creditcardwelcomekit&customerId=197&channel=web

You can access it on author and publish instances.

### Sarah receives a credit card statement {#sarah-receives-a-credit-card-statement}

As Sarah begins to use the credit card, she receives another email from We.Finance that includes her credit card statement. The following images show the email with a link to the credit card statement on mobile.

![statement-email](assets/statement-email.png)

Sarah clicks View Statement in the email to view the credit card statement. The statement is an interactive communication. It has both Web and Print (PDF) versions. The statement integrates with Forms Data Model to retrieve data, specific to the customer, from the database. The interactive statement constitutes various elements:

* Statement summary
* Detailed expense report
* Graphical expense analysis
* Option to make a payment for the due amount from within the statement
* Download the payment receipt

![Different parts of the credit card statement](assets/sara-rose-statement.png)

Sarah doesn’t need to go to the portal or search through her emails for PDF version of the credit card statement for offline archival. She just clicks the Download Statement to download a PDF version of the statement.

The detailed statement is laid out in a responsive table. The statement also provides option to pay a part or the entire due amount from within the statement.

![Detailed statement](assets/statement-details.png)

Sarah schedules payment from within the statement. Sarah can also use the Flexi Pay option to divide payment into equal parts.

#### How it works {#how-it-works-4}

The credit card statement is an interactive communication. The detailed expense table in the statement is a responsive table. The graphic for expense analysis is a chart component and reads the expense table and generates the pie chart.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-4}

You can review the interactive credit card statement at the following URL:

https://&lt;*hostname*&gt;:&lt;*port*&gt;/content/aemforms-refsite/doclink.html?document=/content/forms/af/we-finance/credit-card/credit-card-statement&customerId=197&channel=web

You can access it on author and publish instances.

The credit card statement displays promotional offers towards the end of statement. You can integrate Adobe Target with AEM Forms Interactive Communication to deliver promotional targeted offers based on specific customer segments. To configure your interactive communication to use Adobe Target for customized and targeted offers, see [create targeted experiences](/help/forms/using/experience-targeting-forms.md).

![](do-not-localize/offers.png) 

### We.Finance analyzes the performance of the credit card application {#we-finance-analyzes-the-performance-of-the-credit-card-application}

We.Finance, from time to time, reviews the performance of their credit card application to check for any issues that customers might be facing. They use this analysis to take informed decisions about the changes required in the credit card application to enhance the user experience, reduce abandonment rate of forms, and thereby improve conversion. They leverage the integration of AEM Forms with Adobe Analytics for their analysis. The following image depicts their analytics dashboard.

For more information about how to interpret the analytics dashboard, see [Viewing and understanding AEM Forms analytics reports](/help/forms/using/view-understand-aem-forms-analytics-reports.md).

![cc-analytics](assets/cc-analytics.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-5}

The performance metrics for the credit card application form are tracked using Adobe Analytics. For more information about configuring Adobe Analytics and viewing reports, see [Configuring analytics for forms and documents](/help/forms/using/configure-analytics-forms-documents.md).

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-br}

For you to view and explore the analytics report, we are providing seed data for the credit card application in the reference site.

**A/B testing of the credit card application**

In addition to analyzing performance of the credit card application and constantly improving it, We.Finance leverages integration of AEM Forms with Target to create A/B tests. It allows them to serve different experiences of the credit card application form and identify the experience that causes better conversion rate in terms of form completion and submission.

To configure Target in AEM Forms server, see [Set up and integrate Target in AEM Forms](/help/forms/using/ab-testing-adaptive-forms.md#set%20up%20and%20integrate%20target%20in%20aem%20forms).

## Home mortgage application walkthrough {#home-mortgage-application-walkthrough}

The We.Finance home mortgage scenario involves the following personas:

* Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer
* Gloria Rios, Head of Credit Card and Mortgage, We.Finance
* John Doe, Customer Care Representative, We.Finance

The following infographic depicts step-by-step workflow of a home mortgage application.

![home_mortgage_application_walkthrough](assets/home_mortgage_application_walkthrough.png)

Let’s now look in detail the steps in the reference site scenario to see how the AEM Forms helps We.Finance achieve their objectives.

### Sarah visits We.Finance website and applies for home mortgage {#sarah-visits-we-finance-website-and-applies-for-home-mortgage}

Sarah Rose is planning to buy a home and looking for a home mortgage plans. She is a We.Finance customer and therefore visits the We.Finance portal to explore home mortgage offers. She goes to the Loans section and finds a mortgage calculator on the portal. She fills in the details and clicks Calculate my mortgage, which returns a mortgage plan.

![loans1](assets/loans1.png) ![loans2](assets/loans2.png)
**Figure:** *Mortgage calculator*

![loans3](assets/loans3.png)
**Figure:** *Mortgage calculator result*

#### How it works {#how-it-works-6}

The home mortgage calculator on the Loans page is an embedded adaptive form in AEM Sites page. You can review the Loans page in edit mode at `https://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/we-finance/global/en/loan-landing-page.html`.

The embedded mortgage calculator, which is an adaptive form, uses rules to calculate the EMI amount based on the loan details provided in the calculator fields. You can review the adaptive form at `https://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/hm-calc.html`.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-5}

Go to We.Finance portal at `https://<publishHost>:<publishPort>/content/we-finance/global/en.html` and click **[!UICONTROL Loans]**. Provide details in the mortgage calculator and see the results.

### Sarah finds the offer interesting and chooses to apply {#sarah-finds-the-offer-interesting-and-chooses-to-apply-1}

Sarah chooses to apply for home mortgage and clicks **[!UICONTROL Apply Now]** on home mortgage calculator results. It opens the application for home mortgage.

If Sarah is accessing the home mortgage application from her mobile device, the application form opens in a view optimized for viewing on a mobile device. In this view, the application form renders one section at a time. It allows Sarah to view and provide information progressively as she navigates the application form.

The following images show the workflow as Sarah navigates through the home mortgage application on her mobile device.

![Filling the mortgage application on mobile device](assets/mortgage-form-on-mobile.png)

If Sarah clicks **Apply now** from her desktop, the mortgage application form opens as follows. The information Sarah provided in the mortgage calculator is prefilled in the application form. Sarah fills in the remaining details and clicks **Continue**.

![mortgage-application](assets/mortgage-application.png)

Based on the information Sarah filled in the mortgage calculator, she is presented with a few mortgage plans. She chooses the plan that suits her requirements and continues to fill the application. She finally signs and submits the application.

The submitted application goes to We.Finance for approval.

![Saving a draft application](assets/mortgage-plans.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-7}

The **Apply now** button directs Sarah to the home mortgage application. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instances at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/hm-app.html`.

Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:

* It is based on an XSD schema, `homeMortgageApplication.xsd`.
* It is built using We Finance Theme B for styling and We.Finance template for layout. Also, it uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template and the theme used in the adaptive form at the following locations on your AEM author instance:

    * `https://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance`
    * `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/we-finance-theme-b/jcr:content`

* The first tab, Getting Started, in the application is a dynamic mortgage calculator that displays options based on user selection. For example, the fields and values are different for Purchase and Refinance options. This functionality is achieved using show-hide rules. In addition, when you click Continue and the Plans tab is initialized, it invokes a web service configured in a Form Data Model to fetch and display mortgage plans. You can review the Form Data Models and configured services at `https://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm`.
* It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.
* It uses the Signature Step component to display the completed form and allows electronic signature on the form.
* It uses the Invoke AEM Workflow submit action to trigger the We Finance Home Mortgage AEM workflow. You can review the workflow used in this form at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/we-finance-home-mortgage-workflow.html`

It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.

Also, see the following documentation for more information about features used in the home mortgage application adaptive form:

* [Introduction to authoring adaptive forms](/help/forms/using/introduction-forms-authoring.md)
* [Creating adaptive forms using XML Schema](/help/forms/using/adaptive-form-xml-schema-form-model.md)
* [Rule Editor](/help/forms/using/rule-editor.md)
* [Themes](/help/forms/using/themes.md)
* [Data Integration](/help/forms/using/data-integration.md)
* [Using Adobe Sign in adaptive forms](/help/forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md)
* [Forms-centric workflow on OSGi](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md)

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-6}

Go to `https://[server]:[port]/content/we-finance/global/en/all-forms.html` and click the **Apply now** button on Home Mortgage Application. Fill in the details in the Getting Started tab, try different options, and submit the application.

Ensure that you specify a valid email ID in the application to receive an acknowledgement mail in your inbox.

### We.Finance receives the application {#approving_the_application-1}

We.Finance receives the mortgage application submitted by Sarah. The task to approve or reject the application is assigned to Gloria Rios. She reviews the application and finds that Sarah's government ID is missing.

![grios-inbox](assets/grios-inbox.png)

Gloria opens the task and clicks Need More Info and puts a comment about missing government ID.

![need-more-info](assets/need-more-info.png)

The task is now assigned to John Doe, a customer care representative with We.Finance. He opens the task and reviews Gloria's comment. He contacts Sarah and asks her to send a copy of her ID. After he received a copy of Sarah's ID, he attaches it to the task and submits the application for re-evaluation.

![reevaluation](assets/reevaluation.png)

The task is reassigned to Gloria. She reviews the attached ID and approves the application.

#### How it works {#how-it-works-8}

When Sarah fills and submits the home mortgage application, a Forms Workflow triggers and a task is created in Gloria's AEM inbox. As Gloria reviews the application and requests for more information, the task is assigned to John Doe. When John Doe attaches the ID and resubmits the application, it is assigned to Gloria. This is defined in the AEM Workflow associated with the mortgage application.

AEM Forms on OSGi provides forms-centric workflows that allow you to build adaptive forms-based workflows. These workflows can be used for review and approvals, business process flows, to start document services, integrate with Adobe Sign signature workflow, and so on. For more information, see [Forms-centric workflow on OSGi](/help/forms/using/aem-forms-workflow.md).

The following image depicts the AEM workflow associated with the mortgage application.

![mortgage-workflow-model](assets/mortgage-workflow-model.png) 

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-7}

You can access the AEM inbox at https://<***hostname***>:<***AuthorPort***>/content/we-finance/global/en/login.html?resource=/aem/inbox.html.

### We.Finance analyzes the performance of the mortgage application {#we-finance-analyzes-the-performance-of-the-mortgage-application}

We.Finance, from time to time, reviews the performance of their mortgage application to check for any issues that customers might be facing. They use this analysis to take informed decisions about the changes required in the mortgage application to enhance the user experience, reduce abandonment rate of forms, and thereby improve conversion. They leverage the integration of AEM Forms with Adobe Analytics for their analysis. The following image depicts their analytics dashboard.

For more information about how to interpret the analytics dashboard, see [Viewing and understanding AEM Forms analytics reports](/help/forms/using/view-understand-aem-forms-analytics-reports.md).

**A/B testing of the mortgage application**

In addition to analyzing performance of the mortgage application and constantly improving it, We.Finance leverages integration of AEM Forms with Target to create A/B tests. It allows them to serve different experiences of the application form and identify the experience that causes better conversion rate in terms of form completion and submission.

To configure Target in AEM Forms server, see [Set up and integrate Target in AEM Forms](/help/forms/using/ab-testing-adaptive-forms.md#set%20up%20and%20integrate%20target%20in%20aem%20forms).

## Home Mortgage application walkthrough with Microsoft Dynamics {#home-mortgage-application-walkthrough-with-microsoft-dynamics}

The We.Finance home mortgage with Microsoft Dynamics scenario involves the following personas:

* Sarah Rose, a We.Finance customer
* The Administrator of the We.Finance Microsoft Dynamics instance

The Home Mortgage application walkthrough with Microsoft Dynamics demonstrates how a We.Finance customer can use the site to apply for a home mortgage when the reference site uses the Microsoft Dynamics for data integration. The walkthrough ends with the data filled in by the user being received by Microsoft Dynamics. Before you proceed with this scenario, you need to complete the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 configuration for the home mortgage workflow of the We.Finance reference site](/help/forms/using/ms-dynamics-configuration-home-mortgage.md).

### Sarah visits We.Finance website and applies for home mortgage {#sarah-visits-we-finance-website-and-applies-for-home-mortgage-1}

Sarah Rose is planning to buy a home and looking for a home mortgage plans. She is a We.Finance customer and therefore visits the We.Finance portal to explore home mortgage offers. She goes to the Loans section and finds a mortgage calculator on the portal. She fills in the details and clicks Calculate my mortgage, which returns a mortgage plan.

![loans1](assets/loans1.png) ![loans2](assets/loans2.png)
**Figure:** *Mortgage calculator*

![loans3](assets/loans3.png)
**Figure:** *Mortgage calculator result*

#### How it works {#how-it-works-12}

The home mortgage calculator on the Loans page is an embedded adaptive form in AEM Sites page. You can review the Loans page in edit mode at `https://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/we-finance/global/en/loan-landing-page.html`.

The embedded mortgage calculator, which is an adaptive form, uses rules to calculate the EMI amount based on the loan details provided in the calculator fields. You can review the adaptive form at `https://[authorHost]:[authorPort]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/ms-dynamics/home-mortgage-calculator.html`.

#### See it yourself {#see-it-yourself-10}

Go to We.Finance portal at `https://<publishHost>:<publishPort>/content/we-finance/global/en.html` and click **[!UICONTROL Loans]**. Provide details in the mortgage calculator and see the results.

### Sarah finds the offer interesting and chooses to apply {#sarah-finds-the-offer-interesting-and-chooses-to-apply-2}

Sarah chooses to apply for home mortgage and clicks **[!UICONTROL Apply Now]** on home mortgage calculator results. It opens the application for home mortgage.

If Sarah is accessing the home mortgage application from her mobile device, the application form opens in a view optimized for viewing on a mobile device. In this view, the application form renders one section at a time. It allows Sarah to view and provide information progressively as she navigates the application form.

The following images show the workflow as Sarah navigates through the home mortgage application on her mobile device.

![Filling the mortgage application on mobile device](assets/mortgage-form-on-mobile.png)

If Sarah clicks **Apply now** from her desktop, the mortgage application form opens as follows. The information Sarah provided in the mortgage calculator is prefilled in the application form. Sarah fills in the remaining details and clicks **Continue**.

![mortgage-application](assets/mortgage-application.png)

Based on the information Sarah filled in the mortgage calculator, she is presented with a few mortgage plans. She chooses the plan that suits her requirements and continues to fill the application. She finally signs and submits the application.

The submitted application goes to We.Finance for approval.

![Saving a draft application](assets/mortgage-plans.png) 

#### How it works {#how-it-works-13}

The **Apply now** button directs Sarah to the home mortgage application. The application is an adaptive form, which you can review in the authoring instances at `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/forms/af/we-finance/ms-dynamics/application-for-home-mortgage.html`.

Some of the key features you can review in the adaptive form are:

* It is based on an XSD schema, `homeMortgageApplication.xsd`.
* It is built using We Finance Theme B for styling and We.Finance template for layout. Also, it uses Layout without panel titles in the form header layout for mobile navigation. It displays a progressive mobile layout when opened from a mobile device. You can review the template and the theme used in the adaptive form at the following locations on your AEM author instance:

    * `https://[host]:[Port]/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/templates.html/conf/we-finance`
    * `https://[host]:[Port]/editor.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/we-finance/we-finance-theme-b/jcr:content`

* The first tab, Getting Started, in the application is a dynamic mortgage calculator that displays options based on user selection. For example, the fields and values are different for Purchase and Refinance options. This functionality is achieved using show-hide rules. In addition, when you click Continue and the Plans tab is initialized, it invokes a web service configured in a Form Data Model to fetch and display mortgage plans. You can review the Form Data Models and configured services at `https://[host]:[Port]/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments-fdm`.
* It uses various adaptive form components to capture inputs and adapts to user responses. It also uses components like Email that support HTML5 input types.
* It uses the Signature Step component to display the completed form and allows electronic signature on the form.

It is recommended to review the form to understand the schema, components, rules, Form Data Models, forms workflow, and submit action used to build the form.
