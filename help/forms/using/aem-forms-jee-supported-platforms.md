* MongoDB is third-party software and is not included in the AEM licensing package. For more information see the [MongoDB licensing policy](https://www.mongodb.org/about/licensing/) page.  

* In order to get the most of your AEM deployment, Adobe recommends licensing the MongoDB Enterprise version in order to benefit from professional support.
* Adobe Customer Care will assist qualifying issues related to the usage of MongoDB with AEM. For more information, see the [MongoDB for Adobe Experience Manager page](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/contact/mongodb-adobe-experience-manager).
* 'File System' includes block storage that is POSIX compliant. This includes network storage technology. Mind that file system performance might vary and influences the overall performance. It is recommended to load test AEM in combination with the network/remote file system.
* Only MongoDB Storage Engine WiredTiger is supported.
* MongoDB Sharding is not supported in AEM.
* AEM Forms on JEE does not support MySQL for RDBMK persistence.
* The Document Security module does not use Content Repository. It implies, if you are using only Document Security and do not plan to use HTML Workspace, HTML5 forms, or adaptive forms, then do not install Content Repository.
* AEM Forms on JEE supports Oracle Multitenant architecture.

#### Virtualized environment {#virtualized-environment}

You can run AEM Forms on JEE on a physical machine or a virtual environment. However, if you encounter any issue with AEM Forms on a virtual environment, try replicating the issue on a physical machine. If the issue persists on the physical machine, contact Adobe Support for a resolution. For issues that do not replicate on the physical machine, contact your virtual environment vendor.

### Exceptions to supported server platforms {#exceptions-to-supported-server-platforms}

Consider the following exceptions while choosing a platform to set up your AEM Forms on JEE server.

1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support Oracle WebLogic and JBoss® on IBM® AIX®.  
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support Oracle WebLogic and IBM® WebSphere® with MySQL.
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support Oracle Solaris™ with Intel® architecture (only SPARC® is supported).
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support Oracle WebLogic and JBoss on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12. Only IBM WebSphere is supported on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12.
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support any JDK with JBoss® other than Oracle Java™ SE.
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support any JDK with IBM® WebSphere® other than IBM® JDK.
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support IBM® DB2 with JBoss®.
1. CRX-repository supports persistence of type TarMK, MongoDB, and relational databases (RDBMK). You cannot have two different database systems between the application server and the CRX-repository. However, on an AEM Forms on JEE environment, you can use MongoMK with CRX-repository and a supported relational database with application server.
1. AEM Forms on JEE does not support WebSphere application server on CentOS.
1. AIX and Solaris operating systems are available only for upgrade customers.
1. AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support JBoss role based access control (RBAC).

In addition, consider the following points while choosing software for Adobe AEM Forms on JEE deployments:

* AEM Forms on JEE supports updates, patches, and fix packs on top of the specified major and minor version of supported software. However, update to the next major or minor version is not supported unless specified.
* Cluster-based installations do not support TarMK persistence. For information about supported persistence, see [Choosing a persistence type for an AEM Forms installation](/help/forms/using/choosing-persistence-type-for-aem-forms.md).
* AEM Forms on JEE supports various third-party software as per our [Third-party software support Policy](#third-party-patch-support-policy).
* AEM Forms on JEE supports platforms as per the support provided by third-party vendors. Some combinations may not be allowed by third-party vendors. For example, many vendors have not certified their application servers with IBM® DB2. As a result, AEM Forms on JEE also doesn’t support these combinations. To ensure that you choose the supported software versions, check the support matrix for the third-party vendors as well.  
* AEM Forms on JEE does not support TarMK Cold Standby.
* AEM Forms on JEE does not support vertical clustering.
* AEM Forms on JEE doesn’t support MySQL database on a clustered environment.
* RDBMK does not work with DB2, MYSQL, MS SQL, and Oracle databases when the Package JDBC modules are configured on Weblogic.

### Exceptions to client support {#exceptions-to-client-support}

Microsoft® Windows® 2012 is not supported for all specified client-side software except Reader and Acrobat.

Also, AEM Forms on JEE supports updates, patches, and fix packs on top of the specified major and minor version of supported software. However, update to the next major or minor version is not supported unless specified.

## Third-party patch support policy {#third-party-patch-support-policy}

The third-party software requirements for AEM Forms on JEE are documented in the “System Requirements” section of their respective product documents. All documentation can be accessed from [https://adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_documentation_64](https://adobe.com/go/learn_aemforms_documentation_64) .

AEM Forms on JEE’s third-party reference platforms state the specific patch level of third-party infrastructure that was current during the development and release of AEM Forms on JEE, and from the minimum patch/service pack level of the infrastructure supported by that version of AEM Forms on JEE.

Adobe supports urgent or recommended patches issued by third-party vendors upon their release assuming that third-party vendors guarantee backward compatibility with the versions that AEM Forms on JEE supports. Adobe will only support patches released after the minimum patch level stated in the AEM Forms on JEE documentation.

In some cases, Adobe does not support third-party updates that change major functionality, and thus do not support full backward compatibility. For details on the supported updates, see [Supported patch definitions](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/aem-forms-third-party-software-patch.html) for specific vendor products and the patch types Adobe supports.

Under circumstances beyond Adobe’s control, third-party patches that claim backward compatibility may have negative impact on the Adobe products or customer environments. In such cases, Adobe recommends that customers assess the impact of any urgent patch from a third party before applying them to critical systems. Adobe will work with third parties using reasonable business efforts to resolve such issues, either through normal Adobe support programs or by third parties rectifying the issue in their patch. This does not guarantee that a newly released third-party patch that will be supported by Adobe will work as documented by the vendor or with AEM Forms on JEE.

Adobe reserves the right to change the third-party reference platforms supported by a AEM Forms on JEE release and their supported patch definitions at any given point.

Additional information for third-party patches can also be found by searching the Adobe Enterprise Support site for knowledgebase articles related to your product.
