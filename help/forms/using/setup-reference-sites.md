## Install and configure AEM Forms {#install-and-configure-aem-forms}

Install and deploy AEM Forms as described in [Installing and configuring AEM Forms on OSGi](/help/forms/using/installing-configuring-aem-forms-osgi.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Configure replication and reverse replication agents if there are more than one publish instances or author and publish instances are on different machines.

## Configure SSL {#ssl}

SSL configuration is required to communicate with Adobe Sign servers. For detailed steps, see [Enabling HTTP Over SSL](/help/sites-administering/ssl-by-default.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Do not configure force SSL on `/etc/map` folder.

## Configure Day CQ Link Externalizer configuration {#externalizer}

In AEM, the **Externalizer** is an OSGI service that allows you to programmatically transform a resource path (For example,  /path/to/my/page) into an external and absolute URL (for example, https://www.mycompany.com/path/to/my/page) by prefixing the path with a pre-configured DNS. See [Externalizing URLs](/help/sites-developing/externalizer.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Do not externalize to HTTPS URL if you are using self-signed certificate for SSL.
>
>Also, use localhost instead of its hostname for local server.

Perform the following steps on both author and publish instances:

1. Go to OSGi Configuration at https://&lt;*hostname&gt;*:&lt;*port&gt;*/system/console/configMgr.
1. Find and tap **[!UICONTROL Day CQ Link Externalizer]** configuration.

   The Day CQ Link Externalizer dialog opens for editing the configuration.
   
1. In the Day CQ Link Externalizer dialog, in the Domains field:

    * On the author instance, specify a publish URL that can be accessed from an external system. For example, a hostname or a publishing web server.
    * On the publish instance, specify both the author and publish URLs.

1. On both author and publish instances, ensure that the local server URL is specified in the Domains field.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**. Wait for a while for all services to restart.

## Configure Day CQ Mail Service {#cqmail}

Reference site implementation requires emails to be sent to sample users when they fill and submit forms. Configuring Day CQ Mail Service lets you provide SMTP service details to send automated emails to customers. See [Configuring Email Notifications](/help/sites-administering/notification.md).

Perform the following steps to configure mail service on the publish instance:

1. Go to OSGi Configuration at https://&lt;*hostname&gt;*:&lt;*port&gt;*/system/console/configMgr.
1. Find and tap **[!UICONTROL Day CQ Mail Service]** to open it for configuration.
1. Provide SMTP server hostname and port values.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can use your corporate SMTP service or public services like Gmail. For configuring SMTP service, see SMTP service documentation.

## Override default XSS configuration {#xss}

The email templates for We.Finance reference site contain personalized links in emails. These links have placeholder as `${placeholder}`. These placeholders are replaced by actual values before sending emails. The default XSS protection configuration for AEM does not allow curly braces (**{ }**) in the URL in HTML content. However, you can override the default configuration by performing the following steps on publish instance:

1. Copy `/libs/cq/xssprotection/config.xml` to `/apps/cq/xssprotection/config.xml`.
1. Open `/apps/cq/xssprotection/config.xml`.
1. In the `common-regexps` section, modify the `onsiteURL` entry as follows and save the file.

   `<regexp name="onsiteURL" value="([\p{L}\p{N}\\\.\#@\$\{\}%\+&;\-_~,\?=/!\*\(\)]*|\#(\w)+)"/>`

>[!NOTE]
>
>Curly braces (**{ }**) are included as accepted characters in the URL in HTML content.

After configuring the SMTP server, try to fill a form using the Sarah Rose persona and save it as a draft. When you save as draft, you get an option to receive the draft using email. On tapping the **Send Email** button, if you receive an email with a link to the draft of the application, your email configuration is successful. Ensure that you log in using Sarah's credentials to see the draft.

## Configure AEM DS settings {#aemds}

AEM DS Service settings are required on the Publish instance for email communications in the reference site use cases. For detailed steps to configure AEM DS Service setup on the Publish instance, see [Configure AEM DS settings](/help/forms/using/configuring-the-processing-server-url-.md).

For AEM Forms reference sites, in the AEM DS Settings Service, specify URL of the publish server instead of the URL of the processing server.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Do not put `/lc` in the processing server URL if you are configuring it for AEM Forms OSGi.

## Deploy reference sites packages {#refsite}

Install the following reference sites packages using Software Distribution.

* [AEM-FORMS-6.4-FSI-REF-SITE](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq640/fd/AEM-FORMS-6.4-FSI-REF-SITE)
