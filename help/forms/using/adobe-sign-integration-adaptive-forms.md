# Integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms{#integrate-adobe-sign-with-aem-forms}

Adobe Sign enables e-signature workflows for adaptive forms. E-signatures improve workflows to process documents for legal, sales, payroll, human resource management, and many more areas.

In a typical Adobe Sign and adaptive forms scenario, a user fills an adaptive form to **apply for a service**. For example, a credit card application and a citizen benefits form. When a user fills, submits, and signs the application form, the form is sent to the service provider for further action. Service provider reviews the application and uses Adobe Sign to mark the application approved. To enable similar electronic-signature workflows, you can integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms.

To use Adobe Sign with AEM Forms, configure Adobe Sign in AEM Cloud Services:

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You require the following to integrate Adobe Sign with AEM Forms:

* An active [Adobe Sign developer account.](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/why-adobe/developer-form.html)
* An [SSL enabled](/help/sites-administering/ssl-by-default.md) AEM Forms server.
* An [Adobe Sign API application](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/sign/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobe-sign/master/gstarted/create_app.md).
* Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) of Adobe Sign API application.
* When reconfiguring, remove the existing Adobe Sign configuration from both author and publish instances.
* Use [identical crypto key](/help/sites-administering/security-checklist.md#make-sure-you-properly-replicate-encryption-keys-when-needed) for author and publish instances.

## Configure Adobe Sign with AEM Forms {#configure-adobe-sign-with-aem-forms}

After prerequisites are in place, perform the following steps to configure Adobe Sign with AEM Forms on the Author instance:

1. On AEM Forms author instance, navigate to **Tools** ![hammer](assets/hammer.png) &gt; **General** &gt; **Configuration Browser**.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Configuration Browser]** page, tap **[!UICONTROL Create]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Create Configuration]** dialog, specify a **[!UICONTROL Title]** for the configuration, enable **[!UICONTROL Cloud Configurations]**, and tap **[!UICONTROL Create]**. It creates a configuration container for cloud services.
1. Navigate to **Tools** ![hammer](assets/hammer.png) &gt; **Cloud Services** &gt; **Adobe Sign** and select the configuration container you created in the above step.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Ensure that the URL of the cloud services configuration page starts with **HTTPS**. If not, [enable SSL](/help/sites-administering/ssl-by-default.md) for AEM Forms server.

1. On the configuration page, tap **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create Adobe Sign configuration in AEM Forms.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL General]** tab of the **[!UICONTROL Create Adobe Sign Configuration]** page, specify a **Name** for the configuration and tap **Next**. You can optionally specify a title and browse to select a thumbnail for the configuration.

1. Copy the URL in your current browser window to a notepad. It is required to configure Adobe Sign application with AEM Forms.

1. Configure OAuth settings for the Adobe Sign application:

    1. Open a browser window and sign in to the Adobe Sign developer account.
    1. Select the application configured for AEM Forms, and tap Configure OAuth for Application.
    1. In the **Redirect URL** box, add the HTTPS URL copied in the previous step and click **Save**.
    1. Enable the following OAuth settings for the Adobe Sign application and click **Save**.

    * aggrement_read
    * aggrement_write
    * aggrement_send
    * widget_write
    * workflow_read

   For step-by-step information to configure OAuth settings for an Adobe Sign application and obtain the keys, see [Configure oAuth settings for the application](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/sign/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobe-sign/master/gstarted/configure_oauth.md) developer documentation.

   ![OAuth Config](assets/oauthconfig_new.png)

1. Go back to the **Create Adobe Sign Configuration** page. In the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab, the **[!UICONTROL OAuth URL]** field mentions the following default URL:

   https://secure.na1.echosign.com/public/oauth

   where:

   **na1** refers to the default database shard.

   You can modify the value for the database shard. Restart the server to be able to use the new value for the database shard.

1. Specify the **Client ID** (also referred to as Application ID) and **Client Secret**. Select the **Enable Adobe Sign for attachments also** option to append files attached to an adaptive form to the corresponding Adobe Sign document sent for signing.

   Tap **[!UICONTROL Connect to Adobe Sign]**. When prompted for credentials, provide username and password of the account used while creating Adobe Sign application.

   Tap **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create the Adobe Sign configuration.

1. Open AEM Web Console. The URL is `https://'[server]:[port]'/system/console/configMgr`
1. Open **Forms Common Configuration Service.**
1. In the **Allow** field, **select** All users - All the users, anonymous or logged in, can preview attachments, verify and sign forms, and click **Save.** Author instance is configured to use Adobe Sign.
1. Use [replication](/help/sites-deploying/replication.md) to create identical configuration on corresponding publish instances. 

Now, Adobe Sign is integrated with AEM Forms and ready for use in adaptive forms. To [use Adobe Sign service in an adaptive form](../../forms/using/working-with-adobe-sign.md#configure-adobe-sign-for-an-adaptive-form), specify the configuration container created above in adaptive form properties.



## Configure Adobe Sign scheduler to sync the signing status {#configure-adobe-sign-scheduler-to-sync-the-signing-status}

An Adobe Sign enabled adaptive form is submitted only after all the signers complete the signing process. By default, the Adobe Sign Scheduler services is scheduled to check (poll) signer response after every 24 hours. You can change the default interval for your environment. Perform the following steps to change the default interval:

1. Log in to AEM Forms server with admin credentials and navigate to **Tools** &gt; **Operations** &gt; **Web Console**.

   You can also open the following URL in a browser window:
   `https://[localhost]:'port'/system/console/configMgr`

1. Locate and open the **Adobe Sign Configuration Service** option. Specify a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) in the **Status Update Scheduler Expression** field and click **Save**. For example, to run the configuration service daily at 00:00 am, specify `0 0 0 1/1 * ? *` in the **Status Update Scheduler Expression** field.

Default interval to sync status of Adobe Sign is now changed.
