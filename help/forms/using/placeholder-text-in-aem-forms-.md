# Placeholder text in AEM Forms {#placeholder-text-in-aem-forms}

The placeholder text represents a word or short phrase. It is intended to aid the user with data entry when the control has no value. A placeholder text could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format. The placeholder text is shown before the user enters a value, it is removed when the user enters or selects a value.

>The placeholder text, if specified, must have a value that contains no new line characters.
