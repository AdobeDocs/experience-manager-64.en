## About your contributions to Adobe content

See the [Adobe Docs Contributor Guide](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html).

How you contribute depends on who you are and the sort of changes you'd like to contribute:

### Minor changes or requests

To submit a request, click the **Log an issue** link in an article, which opens an issue in GitHub. Specify a title and a description, and then click **Submit new issue**.

To request minor updates, click the **Edit this page** link in an article, which opens the source article in GitHub. Use the GitHub UI to make your updates. See the general [Adobe Docs contributor guide](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html) for more information.

Minor corrections or clarifications you submit for documentation and code examples in this repo are covered by the Adobe terms of use.

### Major changes or new articles from community members

If you're part of the Adobe community and want to create an article or submit major changes, click the **Issues** tab in the GitHub repository to submit an issue. This submission starts a conversation with the documentation team. You will need to work with the writer (or other Adobe employee) to publish new content.

<!--
If you submit a pull request with significant changes to documentation and code examples, you'll see a message in the pull request asking you to submit an online contribution license agreement (CLA). You must complete the online form before we can review your pull request.

### Major changes from Adobe Employees

If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the product team for an [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Cloud] solution, and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, you should use the private repository at `https://git.corp.adobe.com/AdobeDocs`. See the [Internal Collaboration Guide](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/collaborative-doc-instructions/collaboration-guide/home.html).

<!--Employees from other parts of the Adobe world should use the public repo for minor updates.-->

## Tools and setup

Community contributors can use the GitHub UI for basic editing or fork the repo to make major contributions.

See the [Adobe Docs Contributor Guide](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/contributor/contributor-guide/introduction.html) for details.
